      <description>WHAT IS THIS I have been tinkering with different large language models and vector dbs recently for some client work and some personal projects. Recently, I started working with Llama 2 in order to stop relying on the elephant in the room (OpenAI). The following case study is basically a quick start on working with Llama 2 and semantic search as well. Read on if you aren&amp;rsquo;t bored at this point.</description>
      <content>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-this&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IS THIS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been tinkering with different large language models and vector dbs recently for some client work and some personal projects. Recently, I started working with Llama 2 in order to stop relying on the elephant in the room (OpenAI). The following case study is basically a quick start on working with Llama 2 and semantic search as well. Read on if you aren&amp;rsquo;t bored at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, the model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so most of you reading this are probably already familiar with GPT4 and 3.5 turbo. You probably are also familiar with the billing associated with these models. While not insane for personal projects, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to get anything LLM based into production, you should probably at least attempt to do so without having to pay a tithe to Sam Altman every time your user has a question. This is where Llama comes in. Developed Meta, Llama and its younger (and more powerful) brother Llama 2 are some of the leading open source large language models. Rare Zuck W. Anyway, being open source means that these models can be run locally and deployed on your chosen infrastruture, as opposed to the OpenAI APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this done? Well, you can use HuggingFace (and request model access from Meta), or you can use an awesome tool like Ollama (note: I have zero affiliation with them, they just have a great tool). Ollama allows you to run Llama 2 and other models using Docker or your local machine&amp;rsquo;s native capabilites (MacOS and Linux). It&amp;rsquo;s as simple as downloading the app, model, and then running a couple commands on your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Download Ollama (https://ollama.ai/download)
2. Choose a model (Llama 2, Llama 2 uncensored, or even a variant) NOTE: Be conscious of your machine&#39;s capabilites and the models spec requirements i.e. the 7b model generally requires at least 8GB of RAM, etc
3a. Interact on the CLI directly by running &amp;quot;ollama run llama2&amp;quot; in your terminal
                            or
3b. Call it like you would an API in your app or program (you will see how I did it further below)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, the database (and the data i guess)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we&amp;rsquo;ve got our local model set up and running. Our next step is getting our database sorted and the data inserted. This is where things start picking up a bit in complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, what even is a vector db? If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar, a vector database is used for storing data in the vector format (simple enough so far). What&amp;rsquo;s a vector? While that can be whole article in of itself, at a high-level, a vector is basically a list of numbers that represents an object (like a word, image, etc) as a point in multi-dimensional space. For example, the word &amp;ldquo;cat&amp;rdquo; could be represented as [0.1, 0.3, 0.8] in a 3D vector space. A vector can be used to capture semantic meaning and relationships in data (aka embeddings). A vector db then is a specialized database optimized for storing and querying large collections of vectors/embeddings. They allow fast similarity searches to find vectors close to a query vector in the semantic embedding space. This enables applications like recommender systems which retrieve items similar to a user&amp;rsquo;s interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning about this component in more details, I highly recommend the following resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vicki Boykis&#39; &amp;ldquo;What are embeddings&amp;rdquo; book, &lt;a href=&#34;https://vickiboykis.com/what_are_embeddings/about.html&#34;&gt;https://vickiboykis.com/what_are_embeddings/about.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prashanth Rao&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Vector Databases&amp;rdquo; series, &lt;a href=&#34;https://thedataquarry.com/posts/vector-db-1/&#34;&gt;https://thedataquarry.com/posts/vector-db-1/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this particular case, I decided to work with Qdrant&amp;rsquo;s Vector DB, &lt;a href=&#34;https://qdrant.tech/&#34;&gt;https://qdrant.tech/&lt;/a&gt;. The resources above go into more details regarding the pros and cons of some of the major vector dbs out there, but to keep it short for this piece, I basically chose it because it is one of the newer ones on the scene, it was written in Rust, it isn&amp;rsquo;t postgres, and it works locally using Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, assuming you have Docker itself already set up, here&amp;rsquo;s how to get Qdrant up locally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Run &#39;docker pull qdrant/qdrant in your terminal&#39;
2. Run &#39;docker run -p 6333:6333 \
-v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
qdrant/qdrant&#39;
in your terminal
3. You should now be able to see the db UI at localhost:6333/dashboard and you&#39;ll be interfacing with it programatically at localhost:6333
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so DB is stood up and sorted at this point. The other thing I want to briefly discuss in this section is the data and the scenario this case study presents. I found an Amazon products data set on Kaggle in a .csv format. Given this data, this use case is sort of assuming an e-commerce scenario, where some entity has a product catalog that users may want to search through or ask questions about. I included the data set in the project repo, but you can find it on Kaggle here, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/promptcloud/amazon-product-dataset-2020/&#34;&gt;https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/promptcloud/amazon-product-dataset-2020/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, the thing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing here is an application layer + a couple different features that I added to it. The application will be done with Streamlit (shocker I know) and the features are basically some basic CRUD + semantic search and chat using the model and db running locally (see earlier sections).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s get the application started with creating some data. In this case, we will be uploading CSV files and turning that data into vectors, before uploading those to the vector database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will show the snippets of code, but if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to replicate this demo like for like, check out the actual Github repo to see the full source code. With that said, here&amp;rsquo;s how we start the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/mainpage.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first snippet shows you how to set up the streamlit multipage app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type=&#34;application/javascript&#34; src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dverasc/9f8f90fff1b5d3ba7a3df5c9fca79a87.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each phase of this process (data transformation, data upload to db, and then search and chat) has its own dedicated page within this app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second snippet shows you how we handle our data transformation. At this stage, we are turning our CSV file data into vectors using the HuggingFace Sentence transformer, which is one of the more popular (and open source) models to create embeddings. This process requires us to chunk the data in the csv file, encode our data, then turn that encodding into a numpy array and saving that into a .npy file. You will need this file for the next stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/datatransform.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the code for that step looks something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type=&#34;application/javascript&#34; src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dverasc/f6fdbc0a76ec409de6d88a06bf55eb8e.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After encoding our data and saving it to a .npy file, we need to upload this data into our vector db. If you remember, this case study uses Qdrant as the db. Qdrant supports the use of payloads, which is basically json content that represents any additional information we want to store along with vectors. So in this point in the process, we are looking to submit the vector data and associated payload data to Qdrant. To this, we need to first create the collection, then submit the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/dataupload.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code for that bit is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type=&#34;application/javascript&#34; src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dverasc/2f358622ad8b082f2a237b4f5c6ed6a3.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after running this step, we can navigate to the db UI and see our collection of data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/qdrantui.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/qdrantui2.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is where the fun starts. At this point, we&amp;rsquo;ve got our data properly formatted and transformed to vectors, which are stored in our local Qdrant db instance. With that set up, we can run semantic searches on the data as well as chat over it with a LLM running locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search results are displayed on the streamlit app along with their respective payload data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/searchresults.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/searchresults2.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type=&#34;application/javascript&#34; src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dverasc/43b7001566a1976cb665c6d752f6e411.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also chat over our data using llama-2 uncensored. This uncensored version basically has the guardrails off compared to the standard one. This allows us to get creative with our system prompts and avoid some of the more uhhh HR speak responses that the other version tends to throw out (&amp;ldquo;As an AI I cannot blah blah blah). The fun twist I&amp;rsquo;m throwing in here is that I am setting up the system prompt to force the model to respond in spanish. This obviously has inconsistent results compared to the more typical english scenarios, but I thought it was an interesting wrinkle to add to our case study and to explore more in depth the differences in quality of responses from the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the better results can be seen in this chat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/chatllama.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the code + prompts to get us to that stage can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type=&#34;application/javascript&#34; src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dverasc/687115bac7bbd798e18e8be6f979b764.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also before I forget, if you are having trouble with some of the functions referenced in the gists above, you can find them here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type=&#34;application/javascript&#34; src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dverasc/4d0c46c88735ece65efc9b14b2dc7649.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so uh congrats if you made it this far. You now have a (scaled down and local version) of an LLM based data pipeline. I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting really deep into this space lately (well deep for anyone without a phd) and find it incredibly interesting, commercial value aside. The aspects of this little case study that I found really valuable were all the different open source components that make up the whole end to end pipeline. Most of the documentation and examples out there of systems like these tend to use OpenAI from top to bottom, which can definitely start running up costs. Exploring these open source components has alleviated a little of my anxiety around vendor dependency // lock-in and I highly recommend that anyone attempting to launch LLM based systems consider using these options instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Things to extend&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you may have noticed, this entire project is built to run locally. So the next step would be to take this to a production type of config&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Qdrant does offer some more enterprisy deployment options, including Qdrant Cloud (&lt;a href=&#34;https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud/)&#34;&gt;https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud/)&lt;/a&gt;, a SaaS version that gives you a managed instance of the db basically (note: I have not gone past reading their docs on this product so not sure how it performs. proceed accordingly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ollama allowed us to run these open sourced models locally. this obviously does not work at any sort of scale. With that in mind, HuggingFace has offerings around open source models like Llama 2 + AWS BedRock and equivalent offerings at the hyperscalers also has Llama 2 options for deployment (note: again I have not gotten past the reading docs stage for these services so I can&amp;rsquo;t speak too much about how good they are in reality)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;The co-CEO arrangement would free Diego up to do what he loved – “getting beers with customers,” in the words of two former Wayspire employees. Veras, a self-described “builder at heart,” was at the wheel.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couples notes off the top:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is a very short list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is also a bit late based on the whole posting weekly plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but it&amp;rsquo;s bogo (!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anyways-heres-the-stuff&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANYWAYS HERE&amp;rsquo;S THE STUFF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so here goes my list of things I&amp;rsquo;ve read // researched // found interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;uh-so-is-this-agi-in-the-room-with-us-now&#34;&gt;uh so is this AGI in the room with us now &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.noemamag.com/artificial-general-intelligence-is-already-here/&#34;&gt;https://www.noemamag.com/artificial-general-intelligence-is-already-here/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with a bit of a deeper one this time around. Written by two heavy hitters in the AI space (Blaise Agüera y Arcas and Peter Norvig), this piece&amp;rsquo;s main thesis is that artificial general intelligence (aka AGI) is &lt;em&gt;already here&lt;/em&gt;. This might be uh news to some of us, but the basic idea here is that while we&amp;rsquo;re spending a lot of time bickering about paperclips and acceleration and all that fun stuff&amp;hellip;the thing already happened. AGI is here. And we must grapple with the implications of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so fun buzzwords aside, what do the authors actually mean? The piece starts by trying to position their idea that the current flagship &amp;ldquo;frontier&amp;rdquo; models (basically GPT4, Bard, Llama, and Claude) are advanced enough to be classified as posesing general intelligence, given that they &amp;ldquo;perform competently even on novel tasks they were not trained for, crossing a threshold that previous generations of AI and supervised deep learning systems never managed&amp;rdquo;. The authors go on to define general intelligence, which is where things always get tricky. See, the reason this piece is so interesting is that a lot of the noise we see on social media regarding AI is focused on things in the future (however near or far it may be), because for most people, while the current models are very powerful and innovative, they are not the final state. A huge chunk of the different AI ideological camps believe that AGI is not here and base a lot of their stances off that foundation. This discrepancy happens because there is still no universal definition of what artifical general intelligence is, or how it acts, or how to objectively measure and evaluate it. Not so here. Blaise and Peter&amp;rsquo;s stance is that general intelligence is already here, because the top of the line models can &amp;ldquo;can perform a wide variety of tasks without being explicitly trained on each one&amp;rdquo;, unlike the narrow intelligence of previous generations of models that could only do the singular task they were trained to perform. Specifically, the models can be considered generally intelligent because of their capablity across:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- different topics (basically anything that has been writte on the internet up until the end of their training data)
- a variety of tasks i.e chatbots, agents, media synthesis, media development, etc
- diverse modalities, in the sense that they can work with text, images, video, and robotic sensors
- different languages (bit questionable here, the models overindex on english due to dominance of english on the internet, but they drop off severely as far as other languges go i.e. the less represented the language is on the internet, the lower the capacity of the model to work with it.) 
- instructablity: one shot and few shot prompting have shown that the models can perform quite well in different areas and tasks based on additional context being provided as part of the prompt input (i.e examples of the task or operation the user wants the model to perform)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors also recognize and acknowledge the fact that there are many people who don&amp;rsquo;t agree AGI is already here. They state that this view point stems from a lack of trust in AI metrics, an &amp;ldquo;ideological commitment&amp;rdquo; to AI theories // techniques not based on LLMs, being too pro human (or biological), and // or a concern about the economic effects of artifical general intelligence. They go on to describe these different stances with more depth and a variety of sources from each camp. They do a good job of breaking these down, while still pushing their view point forward as they conclude each point. I&amp;rsquo;ll give you the spark notes here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- lack of trust in AI metrics is basically the fact that no one can agree on a good set of metrics to measure model performance from the perspective of artifical intelligence. Even metrics that we agree on for human intelligence cannot be transfered over cleanly (i.e. models taking and passing law exams), since these models&#39; &amp;quot;training is often narrowly tuned to the exact types of questions on the test&amp;quot;. We also should not falsely assume that intelligence is measured by linguistic fluency (fluent, grammatical responses != intelligence)
- the ideological commitment bit is basically the fact that there are many different fields and disciplines that take stances on intelligence and they have competing theories that go against the current LLM based paradigm of AGI. Linguists, computer scientists, philosophers, and so on all have different theories about intelligence and uh they sorta step on each others toes and throw shade to the others. 
- being too pro-human or pro-biological intelligence (or as the authors put it, &amp;quot;Human (Or Biological) Exceptionalism&amp;quot;) is the innate human bias towards our own sentience and consciousness. I think I fall into this camp occasionally, basically the belief that true general intelligence is inseparable from consciousness, and since these models cannot be said to be sentient in that sense, then they are not truly general intelligent. The authors argue that we should consider separating these concepts and looking past this bias. This train of thought reminds me of the book, Blindsight, by Peter Watts.
- finally, the concern for the economic implications of AGI touches on the political economy of AI and the contrast in automation of manual vs knowledge work. In a fun twist to the usual scenario, LLMs look to have more potential at the automation of knowledge work as opposed to the manual labor that we typically associate with automation.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final point leads to the author&amp;rsquo;s conclusion, which is basically that we have let the genie out the bottle and while we argue about whether the genie is out or not, it&amp;rsquo;s affecting everything around us. So uhh that is super fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this was a thought-provoking piece. While I can&amp;rsquo;t say I agree with the authors on everything, it did make me stop and consider several arguments they put forward and kept me on my current LLM deep dive. Highly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCLAIMER: The second and last item in the list is one of my (non-list) posts. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a couple different proof of concepts with LLMs and semantic search and after tinkering for a couple weeks, decided to write up one of those small projects into a short case study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;The co-CEO arrangement would free Diego up to do what he loved – “getting beers with customers,” in the words of two former Wayspire employees. Veras, a self-described “builder at heart,” was at the wheel.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well uh so I did not make the bogo edition work out last week. I am once again&amp;hellip;late. I sort of figured this would happen (hence my constant referencing of it). There&amp;rsquo;s no real reason as to why I have a schedule in the first place (this is my personal blog, that whoever reads can do so for free, etc), except that I uh tend to be better at things when I establish a routine and I like to commit to things. So, yes I am late again. No, it does not &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt; execept that I want to stick to a certain schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will keep shooting for posting once a week. Fridays will probably continue to be the day I shoot to publish on since (usually) they are a little slower than the other days of the week (except obviously the last two weeks since those Fridays were uh harder than usual).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to my continued lateness, there&amp;rsquo;s some stuff here from a bunch of different points in time since I just kept collecting links instead of you know, writing the damn thing and publishing on time. Whatever. Please find the cool things attached below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anyways-heres-the-stuff&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANYWAYS HERE&amp;rsquo;S THE STUFF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so here goes my list of things I&amp;rsquo;ve read // researched // found interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;batch-vs-streaming-culture-if-you-know-what-that-means-congrats-we-are-nerds&#34;&gt;Batch vs Streaming Culture (if you know what that means congrats we are nerds)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/why-tech-bros-and-politicians-cant-really-connect/&#34;&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/why-tech-bros-and-politicians-cant-really-connect/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so before I get into the thick of this week&amp;rsquo;s first piece I should mention something. This was written by Paul Ford. Disclaimer: As writers (in the non literature // novelist sense) go, my personal favorites are currently Matt Levine, Kyla Scanlon, and (you guessed it) Paul mo***** Ford. So yeah I think this is a good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did Paul actually write about? Well, using a rather clever extended metaphor, Paul broke down the disconnect between the communities that can be described using the &amp;ldquo;tech bro&amp;rdquo; label and the communites that can be described using the &amp;ldquo;utterly useless&amp;rdquo; label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(the joke here is that politicians are useless)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the metaphor is clever. Paul refers to the two ways that these groups view the world as &amp;ldquo;batch&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;event loop&amp;rdquo;. What is &amp;ldquo;batch&amp;rdquo; referring to here? In computing, batch or batching refers to the idea // paradigm where events happen as distinct steps or groups. Paul uses the old timey idea of computer punch cards to illustrate what batching is, &amp;lsquo;Each batch had a discrete Before and After: You did a thing, the computer did a thing, you went back to gathering punch cards&amp;rsquo;. But there are a bunch of other (slightly more modern) examples. One such example of batching is scheduled payroll processing. In many modern accoutning systems, you can schedule a process such as payroll processing to occur at a certain moment in time. This looks something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Payroll is approved 7 days before payment date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Payroll is then run and money withdrawn 3 days before payment date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Payment hits the employee&amp;rsquo;s bank account on payment date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These steps are the Before and After that Paul mentions. The Before is payroll being approved. The computer does the work in the middle. And the After is the money being in the employee&amp;rsquo;s bank account. And on to the next payroll period. Batch is the perspective of the politician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the event loop perspective is the more modern type of computing. Event loops are the more real-time (or real-time like) type of interactions that we expect in today&amp;rsquo;s society. If you&amp;rsquo;re techincally literate, you can think of the event loop idea that Paul poses as something like the idea of streaming processes in data. Watching a TikTok, streaming music, generative AI, and a whole host of other activities that would kill a pilgrim are all event loops. They&amp;rsquo;re an experience, a never ending stream of events, an interactive world that would keep our monkey brains engaged until the sun goes out if it could. This is the perspective of the&amp;hellip;.tech bro for lack of a better word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul&amp;rsquo;s thesis is that these different ways of looking at the world are the fundamental differences between these groups of people and stand in the way of moving society forward (my words not his). This makes intuitive sense to me. Policy and law are inherently reactive matters. They tend to require precedent, which means clear Before and After moments by necessity. Something like seatbelt laws could only be established &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; cars were created, adopted by the masses, and used for enough time that the events like crashes that necessitate seatbelts could happen, which then caused society to come together and create policies focused on car safety and seatbelts. There was a distinct before cars (and seatbelts) were used and a distinct after cars (and seatbelts) began to be used. Tech (and commerce generally speaking) on the other hand, moves much faster. This also makes intuitive sense. Technology and commerce are not bound by precedent. In fact, a lot of the times in these worlds its best to have no precedent (innovation and all that sh*t).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does this ultimately mean? The world is increasingly driven by event loops. And the loops are getting faster. Things feel like they are speeding up, because in some ethemeral senses, they are. The algos react faster, the experiences are more interactive, and our brains continue to move away from a batch perspective on the world. Who knows what&amp;rsquo;s coming next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;isaacson-musk-lame&#34;&gt;Isaacson. Musk. Lame.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ft.com/content/096d1fca-3ee4-4750-8069-9bded7540fab&#34;&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/096d1fca-3ee4-4750-8069-9bded7540fab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk is the worst. He is also very annoyingly always involved in things that touch my life. So I am bound to comment on him from time to time. This is why I included this bit from Alphaville and the FT in this edition of the list. For context, Walter Isaacson, the Patron Saint of Douchebag Apologists, recently released his book on a certain south african POS (Musk not Sacks). The FT post takes a look at the more finanicially relevant parts of this book and trust me, it&amp;rsquo;s much more entertaining than it might sound at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Isaacson talks about Musk&amp;rsquo;s internship at Scotiabank and got the department boss of that time on record discussing young Mr. Musk. This internship was in the strategic planning division of a bank. For the sake of this particular bit, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know much about what internships at a bank&amp;rsquo;s strategic planning division entail outside of you basically do whatever your superiors tell you to do. They will more often than not tell you to do things that are relevant to the bank or a project, but they may not! This is what being an analyst in finance or consulting usually boils down to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of this particular story, Musk was tasked with &amp;ldquo;researching Latin American debt&amp;rdquo; (thrilling I know). During the time period that Musk was at Scotia, the conditions surrounding Latin American debt were basically: banks lent money to countries like Brazil, these countries could not pay back the loans (but they were still &lt;em&gt;obligated&lt;/em&gt; to do so), and so the US treasury secretary packaged these debt obligations into securities that could be traded (the securization of everything and all that). These securities were known as &amp;ldquo;Brady Bonds&amp;rdquo; and were backed by the US gov&amp;rsquo;t. This backing led to Musk thinking they should trade at 50 cents on the dollars, but out in the market they were selling at lows like 20 cents on the dollar. Musk&amp;rsquo;s idea was basically to flip these bonds and he went as far as calling traders at Goldman to get this trade ready. After presenting the idea to his leadership however, they shot it down and said they already had too much Latin America debt and did not want to expose themselves more. Allegedly, Musk walked away from this thinking that it was crazy that banks worked this way and that it was dumb that they did that and his superior is on record saying he thinks that is what gave him &amp;ldquo;the audacity to eventually start what became Paypal&amp;rdquo;. I mean, sure? Like it definitely shows that Musk thought that the way the bank worked was dumb, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really speak to Musk being good at finance or business or any specific audacity. The FT goes on to explain exactly why the bank did not agree with Musk&amp;rsquo;s idea (hint: they were right to do so), but I&amp;rsquo;m going to give you a high level breakdown of why exactly it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have worked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owning these securities meant more than just owning something like a stock. If you held this debt represented as bonds, you had to take part in the meetings, discussions, and plans on how to actually restructure this debt. You couldn&amp;rsquo;t just trade, you had to&amp;hellip;you know&amp;hellip;do some work with the sovereign officials whose country&amp;rsquo;s debt those bonds represented. Banks did not want to do that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk&amp;rsquo;s idea assumed that these bonds would always be worth 50 on the dollar. This is v likely not true, as rates would change over time and this would affect the value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realized returns from these bonds were lower than those available from US stocks and bonds. So basically the bank would be taking on more work than they want to do, for volatile returns that weren&amp;rsquo;t even better compared to normal instruments that the bank was using // could use (&lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0416.00015)&#34;&gt;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0416.00015)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FT piece goes into other sections of the book (check it out, it was v interesting), but I wanted to touch on this one since I had never even heard of Musk working at a bank. Basically, my take away is the idea was not good, Musk is not actually good at finance // business, and Isaacson is a groupie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;i-grift-you-grift-we-all-grift&#34;&gt;I grift. You grift. We all grift.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tante.cc/2023/09/21/the-age-of-the-grift-shift/&#34;&gt;https://tante.cc/2023/09/21/the-age-of-the-grift-shift/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find myself thinking about grifters a lot these days. Between crypto (hello SBF), the recent fascination by media on startups (the Theranos show, the Uber show), and the general shift from ZIRP to whatever we call our current environment, there is plenty of stories of grifters to follow. My very own origin story and start in tech comes from my experience with a local version of these Silicon Valley grifty figures (a story for another day). I say all this to highlight just how&amp;hellip;prevalent grifting has become. The author of this piece does a wonderful job of putting to words a lot of my feelings around this phenomena of grift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thesis of this piece is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Grift Shift is a new paradigm of debating technologies within a society that is based a lot less on the actual realistic use cases or properties of a certain technology but a surface level fascination with technologies but even more their narratives of future deliverance. Within the Grift Shift paradigm the topics and technologies addressed are mere material for public personalities to continuously claim expertise and “thought leadership” in every cycle of the shift regardless of what specific technologies are being talked about.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly this excerpt is so well written and encapsualtes my sentiment so well that it could be the only thing you read from the larger piece and you&amp;rsquo;d still walk away with a better understanding of the environment we find ourselves in (note: it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be, read the whole thing). The author&amp;rsquo;s analysis of why this shift has happened at such speed and scale is worth breaking down as well. Basically, the central idea is that as a society, we have shifted all manner of creative expression to the notion of &amp;ldquo;content&amp;rdquo;. Content is a video, a picture, a sketch, a research paper, a blog post, etc. In the eyes of a CMS, a social platform, or a media publishing system, everything is content. And if everything is &amp;ldquo;content&amp;rdquo; in that typical YouTuber sense, then the priority is not the creative expression of the output, instead the priority is reach, virality, etc. Its about reaching an audience, not making things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift and abstraction coincides with a recent focus on people taking technology and its implications at a naively high level. People talk about AI without talking about the political and economical implications. Thread boys post about the metaverse without drilling down into the source material for the term itself and how it speaks to a world fraught with the very issues we actively avoid talking about it right now. They do this because producing &amp;ldquo;content&amp;rdquo; at a rate that our systems rewards only incentives shallow coverage, not deep analysis. It is a perfect storm of our creativity being abstracted into &amp;ldquo;content&amp;rdquo; that feeds an ever churning system of consumption and people only going surface level on any complex topic or idea to produce this &amp;ldquo;content&amp;rdquo;. Honestly, most people aren&amp;rsquo;t going past surface level on even non complex topics, let alone things like the labor market transformation that large language models might unlock in white collar work. This storm has created an environment that incentives the grift and the shallowness of content, from everyone in society. So, now we must fight the grift. Or be consumed by thread boys. What a future we have created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;this-is-now-a-supplychain-startup-drama-channel-or-something-like-that&#34;&gt;This is now a supplychain startup drama channel. Or something like that&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/02/the-inside-story-of-dave-clarks-tumultuous-last-days-at-flexport.html&#34;&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/02/the-inside-story-of-dave-clarks-tumultuous-last-days-at-flexport.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers of this ongoing series may be familiar with my continued look back at Flexport and all the stories coming out of there. Its because the drama is actually spilling out into the public and I.live.for.this.shit. Corporate back dealings and pettiness is entertaining, actually, and I stand by this principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s new? Well, things are heating up. In September, the Flexport founder and newly reinstated CEO, Ryan Petersen, was at a supply chain conference in Phoenix (I know, its not exactly a NY fashion show or something cool like in a movie). Watching him at this conference? None other than Mr Dave Clark, who is the former CEO. In a classic sh*t talker scenario, Petersen went from trashing Clark internally and on Twitter..to complimenting Clark on his decisions and work around the purchase of Deliverr from Shopify. Trigger fingers turned to Twitter fingers as Plato once said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The piece describes a lot of what this trash talking actually included, with Petersen publicly and privately critizing Dave&amp;rsquo;s impact as having &amp;ldquo;overspent, overhired, and overpromised&amp;rdquo;. He allegedly burned a lot of cash and did things the board did not approve of as he geared Flexport towards an IPO. However, internal records and people on the inside have revealed that the board signed off on all the things that Dave allegedly did without their approval, and that Petersen was looped in and involved on every major decision or initiative that Clark undertook. It&amp;rsquo;s an in-depth piece and I&amp;rsquo;m glossing over a lot of the details comning out of that company, but generally speaking, it looks like we&amp;rsquo;ve got a wonderful corporate drama to keep up with over the next month or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing to keep in mind on this. Flexport apparantly paid Nelly $150k to perform at a recent product reveal event. Petersen decided to cancel this performance because &amp;ldquo;the optics were bad after his post about rescinding job offers&amp;rdquo; (lol, lmao even). Flexport ended up paying Nelly the $150k anyway. Love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaaaaand that&amp;rsquo;s it folks. I did not hit my goal for bogo posts last week, and I had a difficult time getting this one out today, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to refrain from promising anything for this Friday. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll do another one, maybe I won&amp;rsquo;t. The only thing I can sort of commit to is that I will try to post weekly. Let me know if you have any thoughts on this edition or the ongoing series!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the third edition of my Weekly List. We made it to Week III. And also IV. Because this is late. It was bound to happen eventually&amp;hellip;and it did. Technically, this was meant to be published on Friday the 22nd. Today is suspiciously Monday the 25th. What are you gonna do. Things break. People get upset. Fires have to be put out. All that good stuff. Anyways that means this week is a bogo edition, since this Friday we are back to my ambigiously regular programming. Maybe. See above about two sentences back about fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anyways-heres-the-stuff&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANYWAYS HERE&amp;rsquo;S THE STUFF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so here goes my list of things I&amp;rsquo;ve read // researched // found interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;arm-ipos-deloitte-wins-boooo&#34;&gt;Arm IPOS. Deloitte wins. Boooo(?)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ft.com/content/71c08901-3bf1-4435-ae3f-ff608736be33&#34;&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/71c08901-3bf1-4435-ae3f-ff608736be33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard&amp;hellip;.IPO szn is upon us. The public markets have been quiet on the M&amp;amp;A // IPO front recently (hmmm wonder why), so Arm going public is a big deal. I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna get into the details of the initial public offering itself (nor too much into their movement since they were listed). Instead, I thought this piece going into the different service providers &amp;amp; advisors that played a role in this IPO was very interesting since it gives us a peek behind the curtain at the various players. And boy were there were many players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay so some real quick definitions before we get into the details outlined in the article. Buzzword time!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;* Underwriting: underwriting happens in all types of transactions, but generally refers to the process of someone (typically a bank or some specialized financial services provider) asssessing the risk and valuation of a business or asset. This requires a lot of research, financial analysis, and modeling. Underwriting is seen in the context of loans and insurance as well, but in this case, we are talking about finding the value and risks within the company aiming to be publicly listed.
* IPO: aka Initial Public Offering. This is the process that a private company undergoes in order to become a publicly traded company. This process allows a formerly private company (whose shares can only be owned by a small group of accredited investors, founders, VCs, etc) to offer their shares to the general public (aka you and me). Typically this involves a lot of due diligence, underwriting, and generally complying with the SEC and their terms. Companies go public to get additional capital and funding from a wider range of people. Some fun variations of this include SPACS, direct listings, etc. 
* M&amp;amp;A: mergers &amp;amp; acquistions. Basically any type of transaction where a company buys another or sells itself (or parts of itself). While an IPO isn&#39;t a merger nor an acquisition, these types of deals tend to go hot and cold at the same time since they reflect sentiment (aka vibes) in the public markets. If things are chilly in M&amp;amp;A, it&#39;s not very likely that IPOs are still popping.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so now we got some fun buzzwords out of the way, here&amp;rsquo;s an idea of the scale of the process of going public. According to the piece, this initial public offering &amp;ldquo;was the most expensive in fees for five years, earning a $84mn windfall for the professional services firms that advised it, including Deloitte.&amp;quot;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does all that money go to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, mostly to accounting. In an IPO that was &amp;ldquo;seven times more than the average large listing, making it the third most costly in the past decade&amp;rdquo;, the main beneficaires were Deloitte (who audited the accounting) and Morrison &amp;amp; Foerster, who was the main legal adviser in this fun little group project. What does all this money actually get you? Well according to Deloitte, a lot of the (expensive) work came in converting Arm&amp;rsquo;s financial statements to US accounting standards (as opposed to the international standards they were operating with before). Also apparantly Arm&amp;rsquo;s customer contracts are super complex so that also added work to the typical audit. These deals were complex enough to warrant &amp;ldquo;around $51mn&amp;rdquo; going directly to Deloitte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, people pay the most attention to the banks that are helping a startup go public. These banks end up making money directly based on the amount of money raised in the offering. This is to align incentives, i.e. if the IPO goes well, then the bank makes a lot of guap. On the other hand, if it uhhh does not go well (see Pets.com), then the bank will not be making too much money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is different! In this case, we&amp;rsquo;re looking at service providers that get paid on whatever fee gets settled, actual results be damned. In Deloitte and the lawyers case, they got paid based on the work that needed to be done to get to the IPO, with the actual success mattering less than the agreed work between them being executed. In simple terms, the banks make money from a results perspective (we hired you to increase the value, so if you don&amp;rsquo;t increase said value then you make less money) whereas the service providers make money from an execution perspective (we hired you to do task A, B, and C, so do A, B, and C and we will pay you, regardless of what the value ends up being).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Arm jumped to $63.59 per share on the 14th of this month after its IPO price of $51. It ended today trading at $54.44. Make of that what you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DISCLAIMER: I worked at Deloitte many moons ago. I did not work in the service line that works on M&amp;amp;A things so uhhh not super relevant, but still now you know I worked there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mgm-does-not-negotiate-with-terrorists&#34;&gt;MGM does not negotiate with terrorists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really fun piece that really could only happen in the bizzaro modern times we live in. In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t know, the digital world is one giant, gaping security vulnerability. Basically, while some individual actors may have decent cybersecurity, generally speaking we all suck at securing our systems. This is why every other day there is some new story about a company being hacked or a data breach exposing sensitive information. At this point, its fair to assume that your sh*t is floating around in the ether, since no one can secure anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, security incidents tend to follow a certain pattern. A hostile actor(s) manages to breach a company&amp;rsquo;s systems. Usually this company is some sort of organization that holds valuable data (usually of the financial kind). The actors breach, get access to the data, and generally fuck about a company&amp;rsquo;s digital assets. As they fuck around, they&amp;rsquo;ll issue some sort of ultimatum. &amp;ldquo;Send XX bitcoin to XXX wallet or you&amp;rsquo;ll never see the data // get access to your systems again // etc etc&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s sort of like a kidnapping dynamic. Depending on the context and data, a breached company may choose to pay the ransom (I have advised clients to not do this in the past). In this particular series of breaches, some casinos chose to comply and pay the money to get their systems up and runining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOT MGM! They said we do not negotiate with terrorists. We run our casinos even if our machines don&amp;rsquo;t work. This is sick. The author of this piece physically went to the casino to see what it was like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- &amp;quot;At the food courts of eight restaurants I went to, all ordering kiosks were broken. All of the kitchen management computer screens I saw behind the counters were on, but none of them were working. “Unable to connect to kitchen display service. Attempting to reconnect,” they said. A single establishment had a credit card processing machine and cash register. Two workers at that one restaurant were taking orders for all eight restaurants. After a customer ordered, another worker would grab a receipt and physically walk it to whatever restaurant the order was from. I watched the same worker walk back and forth over and over again, grabbing slips of paper from a cashier and walking them down the hall to give them to whatever kitchen needed them.&amp;quot;
- &amp;quot;Workers told me that they have to write every single transaction on these pieces of paper.&amp;quot;
- &amp;quot;The functioning ones are operating in some sort of offline mode. Normally, you can put money on a card, put that card into the slow machine, then cash out onto that card whenever you want. The players cards are not working at all, meaning that you put cash directly into the slot machines, and, when you want to cash out, you tap “cash out” and then you wait an indefinite amount of time for a casino employee to hand you cash at the machine itself.
- &amp;quot;local media outlets were reporting that Larry Flynt’s Hustler Club was offering a deal for “those affected by this devastating event” in the form of free lap dances. Showing proof of a MGM hotel reservation at the club would allegedly get you a slew of other perks, including free airport pickup, luggage storage, and a free platinum VIP membership.&amp;quot;
- &amp;quot;To compare, I briefly walked into the Cosmopolitan, casino that was bought by MGM last year but will not have all of its infrastructure transferred over to MGM’s systems until next year. Every single slot machine, ATM, and everything else was working. I did not see a single out-of-order machine while wandering past hundreds of them. The only thing that was broken was a kiosk for the BetMGM sportsbook&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s think about the what the above implies. Workers that previously could rely on the digital systems we&amp;rsquo;ve all grown accustomed to (kiosks, card processers, etc) were thrown back to what I imagine the 1920s were like. People were cashing out by going up to employees and being like &amp;ldquo;hey I won a dollar, gimme money&amp;rdquo;. Strip clubs were coming together to support their community. What a scene!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, mostly I feel bad for the people working there. I&amp;rsquo;m also fascinated by the people who heard about the hack and still went to gamble. MGM must have some serious brand loyalty.. there were casinos that were working fine after the ransom was paid, but people still went to one whose equipment was in conditions like &amp;ldquo;An automated roulette machine said “No BC Comms.” Lots of machines were simply turned off entirely. A video Blackjack game said: &amp;lsquo;Terminal bloqueado.&#39;&amp;rdquo; Also a fun shoutout to whoever was involved in the IT integration after MGM &amp;amp; Cosmopolitan merged. By not finishing their work, they actually made sure that at least part of the casino&amp;rsquo;s portfolio was mostly unaffected. Distributed systems baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this particular piece to be really poignant given the current state of private markets and the uhhh negative sentiment that people are currently operating in. Belsky highlights a lot of the signs that led to current down market, including the intoxicating allure of the bubble that led to behavior like people &amp;ldquo;starting a company and a fund at the same time&amp;rdquo;. He also breaks down the mechanisms of this bubble including lowered rates, misleading short term patterns &amp;amp; models, and things like &amp;ldquo;party rounds&amp;rdquo;. Basically, he drills down into the different pieces that created an environment that allowed investors to live in a &amp;ldquo;spray and pray world&amp;rdquo; (my words not his). He then does a great job at highlighting lessons that investors, founders, and operators can take away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found his first lesson, &amp;ldquo;Financing is a tactic, not a goal&amp;rdquo;, to be the most powerful. For most of my life and definitely during my time as a professional (I am 25), raising money has been the goal for founders (notice I didn&amp;rsquo;t say what the money is being raised for). People judged quality based on the vanity metrics of their latest funding round or the brand name of their investors. Never mind that they had never turned a profit or found product market fit. &amp;ldquo;Oh no you don&amp;rsquo;t get it, they just raised a round led by a16z so they must be legit&amp;rdquo;. See Adam Neumann&amp;rsquo;s latest company (backed by a16z) and tell me that it has long term potential as an actual business enterprise (hint: it does not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this whole environment never made sense to me. It&amp;rsquo;s not natural. Needing outside money isn&amp;rsquo;t something to brag about! It can be tactically useful to raise capital sure, but it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the actual strategic objective (in case we forgot, that objective should be something along the lines of make more money than you lose). I think its good that we are sobering up. Build businesses, not vehicles for financing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-money-keeps-moving-in-a-circle&#34;&gt;The money keeps moving. In a circle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another week, another hyperscaler &amp;ldquo;invests&amp;rdquo; in a startup. I have a couple thoughts regarding these (fairly frequent) deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) It reeks of executives being scared of anti-trust and finding ways to get around the threat of regulation. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not an acquisition, its a strategic partnership&amp;rdquo; - some corp dev manager to a fed, probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B) It is also hilariously a bit of circular self-dealing. I&amp;rsquo;m attaching a fun little graphic I made to reflect this point, but I&amp;rsquo;ll elaborate a bit more here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- So let&#39;s say I am an AI startup. We will call this startup &amp;quot;Shanthropic&amp;quot;. Let&#39;s say, as Shanthropic, I want to train my own foundational model(s). This requires cloud computing. Cloud computing at this scale is expensive and I&#39;m just a little, scrappy startup so I need money to buy servers (or rent or whatever provisioning model you end up using). Where do I get this money? Well from outside investors of course. Now, here comes a potential investor. They have capital! They say &amp;quot;hey take our money&amp;quot;. So I take it. But then, they also say &amp;quot;we have servers, you should use them (for a price of course)&amp;quot;. So I use them. And how do I pay for them? Well with the money I was just given. My wire transfer says &amp;quot;SchAmazon&amp;quot;. My invoices for cloud stuff says &amp;quot;SchAmazon&amp;quot;. All is right with the world. 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of that &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&amp;rdquo; episode, &amp;ldquo;The Great Recession&amp;rdquo;. Dennis and Mac decide to create their own currency at the bar, sorta like a Dave n Busters vibe. This (as always) does not go well. Plot details aside, they famously describe their little economy with the idea that &amp;ldquo;The money keeps moving. In a circle&amp;rdquo;. It does indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway here&amp;rsquo;s my meme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/circle.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Sam visited the decentralized exchange and took 15 tokens from customers. Sam then lent 3 tokens to his friend who is just him under a different pseudonym and wallet. Then he donated 4 to a bunch of politicans. Later, he took 7 more tokens and sold 2. How many tokens do he have now? Let&#39;s think step by step.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the second edition of my Weekly List. We made it to Week II. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can get to the next. Anyway, this week&amp;rsquo;s piece has more linked articles than the first, mostly because I had a little bit more time to scavenge the Internet than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anyways-heres-the-stuff&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANYWAYS HERE&amp;rsquo;S THE STUFF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so here goes my list of things I&amp;rsquo;ve read // researched // found interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-v-mba&#34;&gt;AI v MBA &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/mba-students-vs-chatgpt-innovation-679edf3b?mod=followamazon&#34;&gt;https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/mba-students-vs-chatgpt-innovation-679edf3b?mod=followamazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fun one. Some professors out of Wharton &amp;amp; Cornell (love it) decided to test a bunch of MBA students versus ChatGPT (4 btw, none of that broke boy 3.5 turbo nonsense) in the realm of&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;innovation&amp;rdquo;. Innovation is defined in their uh research as novel ideas, &amp;ldquo;represented by a pool of 200 randomly selected ideas from our Wharton students&amp;rdquo; for team human whereas team LLM was instructed to &amp;ldquo;generate 100 ideas&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;a new product or service appealing to college students that could be made available for $50 or less.” The machines were also (sampled? questioned? tested?) using few shot prompting techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results? Basically, machines sorta won. Academia says that there are 3 dimensions to gauge creative peformance. These being &amp;ldquo;the quantity of ideas, the average quality of ideas, and the number of truly exceptional ideas.&amp;rdquo; (lmao). Anyways, machines win on quantity measured against time for obvious reasons (stochastic parrot machine go brrr). Based on a market survey that was run against the ideas generated, both the vanilla and few shot GPT generated ideas were more likely to be purchased (human ideas sit at 40%, machines at 40% and 47%). Which means machines beat humans in average quality too. The final category would appear to be the most important, since innovation is typically thought of us as home runs type of game (one in a million unicorn and all that). To gauge this metric, the researchers drilled down into the top 10% of the overall ideas as a result of the market survey and when looking at the source of these ideas, 5 came from the humans and 35 came from the machines (15 for vanilla, 20 for few shot). So, uh not the best showing for humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? Idk not much really. The authors end talking about how the future is copilots, AI assisting humans and etc. I tend to agree with this conclusion. Mostly it is just funny that the population sampled was Ivy League MBA students, who as we all know are the world&amp;rsquo;s most innovative thinkers. Lol, lmao even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pirate-stock-exchange-i-am-not-making-this-up-its-real&#34;&gt;Pirate Stock Exchange. I am not making this up, it&amp;rsquo;s real.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://channel16.dryadglobal.com/the-insanely-lucrative-pirate-stock-exchange-in-somalia&#34;&gt;https://channel16.dryadglobal.com/the-insanely-lucrative-pirate-stock-exchange-in-somalia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may have come across a viral TikTok that went over this insane modern marvel, but if you did not, the title sorta says it all. There is (was?) literally a Pirate Stock Exchange in Somalia. Now, the exact details are murky (no one takes notes on criminal conspiracies like they used s/o Stringer Bell), but the basic gist is that uh there are not many economic levers to pull in Somalia so some enterprising folks recognized that one of the ones they could pull on was well&amp;hellip;piracy. So, a market was created where non pirate locals could contribute money to different&amp;hellip;pirate ships (not joking), and if // when the mission was succesful, the non pirate investors would receive an appropriate share of the gains. You can imagine some of the dynamics of this market. Sometimes the investors put in equipment or insider tips on good targets instead of actual capital. Some of the more operationally minded investors would help plot out the routes and logistics of each&amp;hellip;..endeavor. There was also a lot of bribery, and corruption, and violence. BUT. ALSO. &amp;ldquo;One lady invested an RPG-7 towards such a venture and apparently received a hefty US$75,000 (UA$104,000) in return.&amp;rdquo; I mean, come on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT ENDORSE CRIME NOR PIRACY NOR CAPITALISM.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;commentary-on-commentary-on-commentary-thats-what-im-doing-also-remember-finstas-social-media-is-weird&#34;&gt;Commentary on commentary on commentary. That&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m doing. Also, remember Finstas? Social media is weird.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://embedded.substack.com/p/were-all-lurkers-now?isFreemail=true&amp;amp;post_id=136930409&amp;amp;publication_id=312088&amp;amp;r=2fujza&#34;&gt;https://embedded.substack.com/p/were-all-lurkers-now?isFreemail=true&amp;amp;post_id=136930409&amp;amp;publication_id=312088&amp;amp;r=2fujza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piece by Kate Lindsay focuses on the unique moment that social media finds itself in. People aren&amp;rsquo;t posting like they used to. Specifically, people have stopped seeing social media as a way to connect with their actual social graph. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s all about broadcasting to an audience. Like a brand does. The quote from Insider that Kate uses puts it perfectly, &amp;ldquo;As more people have been confronted with the consequences of constant sharing, social media has become less social and more media.&amp;rdquo; I think we all know what this is referring to. It&amp;rsquo;s the Instagramification of things. Everything is an ad or a promo or a very targeted mechanism to do something. Even shit posting is monetized! So now everyone is either on Discord or group chats or DMs to actually talk and share with their social groups. And if they have something to promote // sell, they will post. Sick. Love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something will give I&amp;rsquo;m sure. Being on social media these days feels like being around at the end of something. It feels like the last sigh of an era as it dies. Who knows what comes next? (it&amp;rsquo;s not Mastodon, sorry nerds)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;corporate-culture-is-dead-long-live-corporate-culture&#34;&gt;Corporate culture is dead. Long live corporate culture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dirt.fyi/article/2023/09/corporate-culture&#34;&gt;https://dirt.fyi/article/2023/09/corporate-culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a really interesting look at the fracturing of corporate culture and how our cultural images and artifacts have shifted over time. Michelle sets the context really well by positing the Ad men of the US as one of those really strong cultural images, that then morphed into the&amp;hellip;weirdly aspirational interpretation of American Psycho and Wolf of Wall Street as the more modern cultural images. From those archetypes we got things like finance bros and techbros and all those 2010s grindset memes. Like so many legacy cultural waves however, these different artifacts and representations are becoming fragmented, splintering into their own variants as media consumption becomes more and more personalized and niche. Its the death of the monoculture of corporate. And what a death. Between this fragmentation and the huge shift in how we see employment after COVID, labor (aka people) now finds itself without these cultural images and artifacts that often worked as a kind of veil over the common issues that we all struggled with. Now that this veil is splintering, we&amp;rsquo;re left with Day in the Life tik toks as we keep fighting for higher pay, health insurance, and less assholes around us as we work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;machines-do-be-reasoning-or-maybe-not&#34;&gt;Machines do be reasoning. Or maybe not&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://aiguide.substack.com/p/can-large-language-models-reason&#34;&gt;https://aiguide.substack.com/p/can-large-language-models-reason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More technical than the other pieces this week, I found this substack piece to be a really insightful and digestible take on the whole is AI actually thinking debate. This piece in particular is framed as: can LLms &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt;? What is reasoning? In this case, it is defined as &amp;ldquo;a process that involves composing multiple steps of inference.&amp;rdquo; In other words, it&amp;rsquo;s the ability to abstract, to approach things generally, in such a way that its more than simple pattern matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do LLMs posssess this ability? Melanie lays out some of the research done in this area and what it finds. Generally speaking, the bulk of this research is focused around chain of thought prompting, which is basically a prompting technique that gives the model some example problems + the reasoning to solve it, then asks it to use that reasoning towards a new problem that the user presents (there&amp;rsquo;s also zero shot chain of thought, which is really just adding a phrase like &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s think step by step&amp;rdquo; to your prompt, which I love). An example of such an interaction is something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;**Prompt**
The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 4, 8, 9, 15, 12, 2, 1.
A: Adding all the odd numbers (9, 15, 1) gives 25. The answer is False.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 15, 32, 5, 13, 82, 7, 1. 
A: 

**Answer**
Adding all the odd numbers (15, 5, 13, 7, 1) gives 41. The answer is False.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of zero shot prompting is something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; **Prompt**
I visited the bookstore and purchased 15 books. I lent 3 books to my friend and donated 4 to the local library. Later, I bought 7 more books and sold 2. How many books do I have now? Let&#39;s think step by step

**Answer**
You visited the bookstore and purchased 15 books.
Initial count: 15 books
You lent 3 books to your friend.
To find out how many books you have left, subtract the 3 books you lent from the initial count: 15 - 3 = 12 books
You donated 4 books to the local library.
Now, subtract the 4 books you donated from the current count: 12 - 4 = 8 books
You bought 7 more books.
To find out the updated count, add the 7 books you bought to the current count: 8 + 7 = 15 books
You sold 2 books.
Lastly, subtract the 2 books you sold from the updated count: 15 - 2 = 13 books
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where it gets funky: we don&amp;rsquo;t actually know if this their actual thought process. The models aren&amp;rsquo;t trained to reply their own internal mechanism to reaching a certain output, they are trained to predict the most statistically likely token to appear next given an input (within the context of said input). Which means there is no way to tell if this chain of thought output is actually what is happening under the hood. In a lot of ways, it&amp;rsquo;s just telling us what it &amp;ldquo;thinks&amp;rdquo; we want to hear! What fun problem to be digging into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;flexport-is-uh-not-doing-too-hot&#34;&gt;Flexport is uh not doing too hot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/flexports-revenue-dropped-70-in-first-half-of-2023&#34;&gt;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/flexports-revenue-dropped-70-in-first-half-of-2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So last week, I ended with a tweet and some general context around the fun insider drama happening at Flexport. Specifically, I ended saying to watch this space. Well, space has been watched. Or something. I don&amp;rsquo;t know, the point is, more info came out around what&amp;rsquo;s going on over there and it turns out&amp;hellip;things are not that good (lol). Their revenue dropped 70% (!) in the first half of the year as the freight market went downhill around it. This cyclicality intuitively makes sense, since supply chain woes have lessened as we came out of the unique COVID environment. This means a lot of the high margins players in this space could command are sort of not really there anymore. Flexport specifically made a lot of money by taking a cut of the costs of shipping services. With shipping rates coming back down as the supply chain loosened, that cut got smaller and smaller. Still, that&amp;rsquo;s a huge decrease in revenue. Should be a fun time for Ryan. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what else comes out over the next couplew weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaaaand that brings the second Weekly List edition to a close. If you made it this far, thanks for reading and keep an eye out for next week&amp;rsquo;s edition. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll write it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>WHAT IS THIS &amp;quot;The world, unfortunately, is real; I, unfortunately, am Diego.&amp;quot;  Okay so I have not written in a while. Lot of things are happening, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get better at the discipline that is writing. Due to that, I have created a new thing for myself that I&amp;rsquo;m calling my &amp;ldquo;Weekly List.&amp;rdquo; Basically, I am going to try to start curating and tracking the many pieces of long form content that I consume and write about what I think of them.</description>

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;The world, unfortunately, is real; I, unfortunately, am Diego.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so I have not written in a while. Lot of things are happening, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get better at the discipline that is writing. Due to that, I have created a new thing for myself that I&amp;rsquo;m calling my &amp;ldquo;Weekly List.&amp;rdquo; Basically, I am going to try to start curating and tracking the many pieces of long form content that I consume and write about what I think of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my thinking behind this is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) I have trouble finding the time // focus // (insert excuse here) to do long form pieces in a traditional format. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this might help me write more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B) I send people links of things I&amp;rsquo;ve read that I like and they end up lost in the ether of continuous digital chat. This will help track it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C) Relatedly, said people have told me I read more long form content than most. Assuming this is true, maybe I can leverage that and help curate content for others. Maybe. I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anyways-heres-the-stuff&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANYWAYS HERE&amp;rsquo;S THE STUFF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so here goes my list of things I&amp;rsquo;ve read // researched // found interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-deep-dive-into-telecom--networking-companies-with-an-eye-towards-ai&#34;&gt;A deep dive into telecom &amp;amp; networking companies with an eye towards AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.inevitabilityresearch.com/p/the-future-of-networking-and-telecom&#34;&gt;https://www.inevitabilityresearch.com/p/the-future-of-networking-and-telecom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably my longest read of the week and one of the most comprehensive pieces I dove into recently. Sophie put together a v. in-depth report breaking down the network &amp;amp; telecommunications sector and its various subsectors (aka companies that make money from moving bits of data around). They managed to bring together all the different levels of abstraction, tooling, and components of these very distinct specialties and subsectors and synthesize all that into an analysis that very clearly ties together into the current AI boom cycle and paints a clear picture towards the long term trends we&amp;rsquo;re seeing develop in front of us. The sections on edge computing and data centers were particularly interesting to me, and I love how they provided relevant players for each sub-sector that they broke down. A great piece from a great author and poster. Go check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-look-into-rotten-tomatoes-that-leaves-you-feelingrotten-booooooo&#34;&gt;A look into Rotten Tomatoes that leaves you feeling&amp;hellip;rotten (booooooo)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vulture.com/article/rotten-tomatoes-movie-rating.html&#34;&gt;https://www.vulture.com/article/rotten-tomatoes-movie-rating.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so this one is really interesting to because I am the king of not watching things without checking the Rotten Tomatoes rating. It&amp;rsquo;s uh not exactly surprising that this system has been gamed (what part of the godforsaken internet hasn&amp;rsquo;t been?), but it is really sad that the state of the film // tv industry relies on Rotten f***** Tomatoes (also sort of funny in a cynical way?). Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s the basic gist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1.  Rotten Tomatoes started out as one of those seemingly innocent webpages that sprung up in the Web 1.0 years 

2.  As time passed and the dot com bust came and went, RT continue to be bought and sold in a decades long series of M&amp;amp;A transactions and &amp;quot;synergies&amp;quot; being discovered

3.  Its final destination was Fandango, who acquired it in 2016ish I believe

4.  By this point, Rotten Tomatoes became THE signal for quality in film and tv. Its reviews make or break releases. This made it a prime target for every suit in the world to try to juice their ratings and hit those sweet, sweet KPI-tied bonuses and whatnot.

5.  Becoming the de-facto sign of quality in Hollywood has uhhh not been good for anyone really? The formula that RT uses for its rankings is so simple that I laughed out loud when I read it (&amp;quot;Scores are calculated by classifying each review as either positive or negative and then dividing the number of positives by the total&amp;quot;) and the team behind it has never been able to really identify the best way to incenvtize user behavior towards a platform that actually provides value to its users.

6.  As the article shows, all this had led to a v. easily manipulated system that PR firms, media execs, and other non creative stakeholders are constantly trying to game in order to shape public perception and reception of films and tv shows. There is no source of truth anymore. 

7.  Suffice to say, this has led to v. weird situations (i.e Ant-Man Quantum Mania released to a 79 rating and a massive opening weekend, then fell to the 40s, after which it had the worst drop off in Marvel history in the following weekend) recently and makes me want to never trust a review again.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what else to say except that this sucks? And I&amp;rsquo;m not sure anyone really benefits except for PR reps and rando studio VPs, so it sucks even more. At this point, it feels like every piece of digital real estate is some disappointing vehicle for manipulation focused on driving money to the people contributing the least, which just leaves you feeling slightly gross. So that&amp;rsquo;s super fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-soulful-post-breaking-down-loneliness-and-the-fragmentation-of-our-despair&#34;&gt;A soulful post breaking down loneliness and the fragmentation of our despair&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kyla.substack.com/p/fragmentation-polarization-and-the&#34;&gt;https://kyla.substack.com/p/fragmentation-polarization-and-the&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyla is one of the best writers // thinkers in econ today and this piece is a testament to that. I haven&amp;rsquo;t found anyone that captures the real humanity behind econ &amp;amp; finance like she does and this particular post hit me pretty strongly.
She (very accurately) describes the feelings of nihilism and almost social homelessness of the modern age, the breaking of the social contract that we are all reeling from, and manages to tie together a lot of different topics into a main thesis that is particularly poignant for people our age,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Because there is a void of community, because we are trying to calibrate to suffering, because we are waiting for a marshmallow, but waiting is the actual dystopia. We have misplaced outrage that we turn into consumption of videos about Fake Karens. We get behind people selling a newsletter subscription about how the world is going to end.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a society that is constantly bombarded with information, and data, and news, and we are told that the world used to be a certain way and that there were these rules that had to be followed and then we look up and away from our screens and realize nothing that we were told is true. We live in the constant storm of content and outrage and numbness and the vague notion that things aren&amp;rsquo;t how they ought to be. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly point to a silver bullet solution (because there is none), but as always, she ends her piece with words // thoughts that follow me long after I finished reading (this time courtesy of Borges),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Time is the substance I am made of. Time is a river which sweeps me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger which destroys me, but I am the tiger; it is a fire which consumes me, but I am the fire. The world, unfortunately, is real; I, unfortunately, am Borges.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dave-is-no-longer-being-allowed-to-cook-at-flexport&#34;&gt;Dave is no longer being allowed to cook at Flexport&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/typesfast/status/1700092765798048093?s=20&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/typesfast/status/1700092765798048093?s=20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is not long-form content, instead its a tweet from the founder and newly returned CEO of Flexport announcing that one of his first moves is to&amp;hellip;.rescind job offers? Sort of a weird move given his recent tweets were focused on the large &amp;ldquo;war chest&amp;rdquo; his company has + a private jet his company owns (lol), but I think aside from being a needlessly cruel corproate action, it also speaks to some weird stuff going on around that particular company. To provide some brief context, last year, the outgoing CEO, Dave Clark, came in from Amazon to take the reigns from the founder (and now once again CEO), Ryan Petersen. Ryan went on to become the Executive Chairman, a partner at Founders Fund, and one of the last few posters on the hellsite formerly known as Twitter. Then at some point in the last couple weeks, some beef happened (?) and Dave was fired by the board (presented as a resignation), and Ryan came back in. The interesting bits is how all this went down. Dave&amp;rsquo;s outgoing memo basically said &amp;ldquo;I had a plan, these people have a dumber plan that I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with, so I am out&amp;rdquo; and then days later, Ryan started tweeting about rescinding job offers, subleasing office spaces, and pretty much throwing Dave under the bus. There&amp;rsquo;s not too many details out just yet (hence why I&amp;rsquo;m posting a tweet and not a longer form piece), but I am v. curious to see what comes out of this. Keep an eye on this space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that concludes the first installment of my Weekly List. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope there&amp;rsquo;s another one next week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Earlier this week I ran a workshop on APIs for some of the Arcvale team. The level of technical experience was fairly varied, so I tried to strike a balance between going very in depth while still making things palatable for a less technical audience. Hopefully someone finds it useful.</description>

      <description>2023 has been the year of the LLM. Between the ChatGPT explosion and the AI bubble replacing the crypto wave, there has been a lot of interest in this new space.

For the sake of having one place to point them to (plus giving myself a centralized repo for future reference), I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled them here:</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;2023 has been the year of the LLM. Between the ChatGPT explosion and the AI bubble replacing the crypto wave, there has been a lot of interest in this new space. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of clients and teammates reach out asking how to learn more about the technology. For the sake of having one place to point them to (plus giving myself a centralized repo for future reference), I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled them here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.eladgil.com/p/ai-revolution-transformers-and-large&#34;&gt;https://blog.eladgil.com/p/ai-revolution-transformers-and-large&lt;/a&gt;: a bit dated by the standards of change in the space (all the way from 2022), but presents a really good, high level view on LLMs from a more venture // product focused perspective. good read for those that wear business hats and/or those trying to build products that leverage LLMs. If you have more meetings than you have time to code or research, this is probably the one for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/&#34;&gt;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/&lt;/a&gt;: truly one of the best explainers on what&amp;rsquo;s going on under the hood of these large models. it can be a bit technical (especially for more business facing folks), but I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a better resource for anyone that wants to wrap their head around what these models are actually doing and dive deeper than an AI threadboy on twitter. I&amp;rsquo;d say its mandatory reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762&#34;&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762&lt;/a&gt;: the paper that kicked this all off. At the time of its release, the authors were working out of Google&amp;rsquo;s AI research divison. This paper introduced the transformer architecture, which led to the explosion of transformer based foundation models that are being released to the wider public. Some novel and key concepts of the architecture were first introduced here, such as the idea of an encoder and decoder, the self-attention mechanism, and multi-head attention (hence the title of the paper). This paper was the shot heard around the world in the world of NLP and machine learning (and may have led to some people discovering their life&amp;rsquo;s work was being tossed out the window aka those working with more tradional neural networks). Another mandatory read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sh_reya/status/1641106353971421185?s=46&amp;amp;t=ZLo4tFybLFJgtQK6NBj3fQ&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/sh_reya/status/1641106353971421185?s=46&amp;amp;t=ZLo4tFybLFJgtQK6NBj3fQ&lt;/a&gt;: great twitter thread offering an insider perspective on taking these models to production and introduces some very pertinent questions around the Ops side of LLMs and LLM based apps. A lot of the questions posed are yet to be answered, which highlights how early we are in this particular space. Exciting times!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ai.stanford.edu/blog/understanding-incontext/&#34;&gt;https://ai.stanford.edu/blog/understanding-incontext/&lt;/a&gt;: this particular piece focuses on one specific aspect of LLMs&amp;hellip;.the idea of &amp;ldquo;in-context&amp;rdquo; learning. Considered an emergent behavior (aka we still don&amp;rsquo;t actually know why models can do this), in-context learning is the concept behind techniques like few-shot prompting, where essentially we provide input-output examples to the model in order to shape its response without having to finetune or mess with parameters. Very wild to consider the implication of emergent behaviors with this technology. Exciting times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@atmabodha/pre-training-fine-tuning-and-in-context-learning-in-large-language-models-llms-dd483707b122&#34;&gt;https://medium.com/@atmabodha/pre-training-fine-tuning-and-in-context-learning-in-large-language-models-llms-dd483707b122&lt;/a&gt;: another good piece that touches on in context learning, but from a higher level. Also provides a good primer on alternative techniques like fine-tuning. I like this resource since I find it helpful to compare the techniques in order to get a better grasp of each one&amp;rsquo;s characteristics, pros, cons, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hai.stanford.edu/news/language-models-are-changing-ai-we-need-understand-them&#34;&gt;https://hai.stanford.edu/news/language-models-are-changing-ai-we-need-understand-them&lt;/a&gt;: a bit of a different subject matter compared to the other resources I&amp;rsquo;ve linked here, this particular piece puts forward a framework on how to benchmark the different models out there in the wild and tries to bring some standardization to the wild wild west of language models. I recommend this for anyone in a decision maker role trying to evaluate the various options available in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://daleonai.com/transformers-explained&#34;&gt;https://daleonai.com/transformers-explained&lt;/a&gt;: a little older than some of the others linked here (2021), this piece explains transformers with some really excellent visuals that really helped ground some of the concepts behind the architecture that defines the transformer based models. It is a very helpful companion to the original &amp;ldquo;Attention Is All You Need&amp;rdquo; paper. Strong recommend for anyone coming from a non traditional ML background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/&#34;&gt;https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/&lt;/a&gt;: another good visual piece breaking down transformers and their architecture that goes more in depth than the one mentioned above. Similarly, I think this is a good companion for the original paper since it provides more visually appealing content (love a good illustrated guide) and its not necessarily geared towards a research audience, which makes it a gentler read for anyone who is not ML/stats/research-pilled. Once again, a strong recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/04/an-introduction-to-generative-ai-with-swami-sivasubramanian.html&#34;&gt;https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/04/an-introduction-to-generative-ai-with-swami-sivasubramanian.html&lt;/a&gt;: bit different than the other items in the list, this particular piece is an interview with Swami Sivasubramanian. I found it interesting since it provided some perspective on how the large cloud providers are leveraging their advantages as incumbents to work the whole &amp;ldquo;sell shovels during a gold rush&amp;rdquo; angle. Not too long either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/building-god&#34;&gt;https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/building-god&lt;/a&gt;: also a bit different than the other pieces, this particular substack post tries to attack some of the heavier concepts in the space (what is intelligence?) while also getting into the thick of it by breaking down how &amp;ldquo;agents&amp;rdquo; may work to become reflective and improve upon themselves. Feels like a glimpse into a near future in a lot of ways. Click-baity title is also kind of cool so I have to give credit where its due (also ty to the author for using the lower case g, my inner Catholic appreciates it). Once you think you&amp;rsquo;ve got some sense of transformers, large models, etc from a technical concept perspective, jump into this piece and the one below in order to get your brain thinking about the implications of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://moultano.wordpress.com/2023/06/28/the-many-ways-that-digital-minds-can-know/&#34;&gt;https://moultano.wordpress.com/2023/06/28/the-many-ways-that-digital-minds-can-know/&lt;/a&gt;: this one is fun because it combines some technical content with ideas that get to the heart of the philosophical debate raging in tech right now. What does it mean to &amp;ldquo;think&amp;rdquo;? How are statistical predictions on next token up able to achieve capabilities that we though were reserved for humans? Honestly, its a great piece from both an educational perspective but also a little metaphysical. Finish your reading with this piece if you want to go into even more rabbit holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>It’s October 2021. You just finished flipping an NFT for double your salary after hearing a Gary Vee video snippet about how this doodle is the future of all commercial activity. You glance away from your Robinhood screen to look at the latest news and you see that God King Zuck has announced that his social media empire is rebranding…..from Facebook to “Meta”. He’s putting his money where his mouth is and going all in on the “Metaverse&amp;quot;.</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s October 2021. You just finished flipping an NFT for double your salary after hearing a Gary Vee video snippet about how this doodle is the future of all commercial activity. You glance away from your Robinhood screen to look at the latest news and you see that God King Zuck has announced that his social media empire is rebranding…..from Facebook to “Meta”. He’s putting his money where his mouth is and going all in on the “Metaverse&amp;quot;. You quickly google “Metaverse” on one tab while perusing all the domain names that have anything to do with “meta”. This is it. The new platform shift. Technology is going to change forever, just like with mobile. Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s like the cloud era. You’re not exactly sure yet (after all, the only thing you know about VR is Beatsaber and Metaverse sounds like a weird defunct Disney attraction), but you know it’s going to be big. Maybe this is the end of history for consumer technology? Perhaps Fukuyama was on to something, he just forgot about the headsets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, you can snap out of it. We’re back to 2023. Crypto is in its newest winter, the Fed hates easy money, and all the cool kids are talking about AI. So why are we still in our meat suits and why did the Metaverse never show up? What happened to the paradigm shift to end all paradigm shifts? Well, simply put, technology is hard and consumers are not a patient bunch (generally speaking). Paradigm shifts are rarely one specific moment (and very rarely do they involve a rebrand). They usually are a series of incremental improvements, one step farther than the last (one could say it involves standing on the shoulders of giants). With that in mind, what I want to focus on is the bit about technology being hard. I’m quite aware that most people understand that science, software, and hardware are difficult. But I don’t think we ever truly reflect on just how difficult it is. So today, I want to break down the very specific aspects of the underlying “Metaverse” technologies and why our time window for expecting its arrival is not a matter of a couple financial quarters, but of several more years (if not decades) of R&amp;amp;D. So, what happened to the Metaverse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IS THE METAVERSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I think we should establish some sort of baseline definition and idea around what the Metaverse is meant to be. To do this, I will be leaning strongly on Matthew Ball’s work and how he defines the concept (you will see a lot of Ball’s influence here since he is probably the most clear thinker on these ideas from a commercial and consumer perspective). Ball defines the Metaverse as “a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds that can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments.” Lots of buzzwords in there right? Let’s break down this definition into its components to get down to the heart of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition starts with the idea of a “massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds”. What is this really talking about? Well, the first bit of it, the  “massively scaled and interoperable network” is similar to the idea of the Internet. Massively scaled means it has to essentially be of a global scale. We’re talking available in every continent. The internet’s utility has increased due to more and more of humanity having access to it as consumers and contributors. Similarly, the true value of the Metaverse will lie in its reach and adoption by the global population. If you’re not familiar with the resources required to reach this “massive” scale, read about the underwater cables that make up the foundation of the internet. Interoperability is the idea of a system being able to interact and function with other systems. Again, using the Internet as an example, the world wide web is really more like a variety of local network systems that all communicate with each other in a sort of lingua franca (protocols like TCP and whatnot) to create a larger network that stretches across the globe. All the components behind the Internet are built with the idea of exchanging information with a variety of systems in a consistent manner across the board. This consistency allows the larger network to continue to grow as different parts of it change and emerge. The Metaverse will have to operate in a similar manner, able to be accessed through an Oculus headset as well as an Android mobile device as well as insert XYZ device here. It must be built with a lingua franca in mind. Next is the idea of “real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds”. These buzzwords are probably a little less opaque. Real-time refers to the idea of things happening with no delay (I do x action and y happens without a buffer of time). 3D virtual worlds are the easiest to conceptualize since some of these already exist (most VR experiences could be said to occur in or encapsulate a 3D virtual world). However, it’s important to highlight that the Metaverse is not one of these worlds (same as how Facebook is not the Internet regardless of how much Zuck wants it to be), but it is the environment in which these worlds “exist” unto one another. Much like the internet is a network of networks, the Metaverse should be a world of worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of Ball’s definition focuses more on how this interoperable and 3D rendered network will // should operate and how we will experience it.  The focus in the definition is that it should be experienced “synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments”. Basically, this network should support simultaneous use and reflect a live and constant experience. This live and constant experience should be the same for an unlimited number of users (total market is essentially the whole world much like the Internet) and include the ability for data to continually be captured and utilized through models &amp;amp; concepts like who you are in this experience (and who others are) as well as the ability to shop, talk to those others, and have a record of these things existing. The important bit here is for all of this to occur persistently. The bar for this persistence is 24/7. There can be no downtime. This is site reliability on steroids. It should be noted there is no example of this out in the wild. A lot of game design is based around tricking you into thinking these things are happening, but there is no actual system out there that can do the things defined so far. Which leads nicely into the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IS SO HARD ABOUT IT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do hands-on technical work in any way, what I’m going to say in the following section shouldn’t come as a surprise. To be clear, all of the qualities I outlined above are not represented in any product, game or experience in the present. The aspects of the Metaverse concept that are generally accepted as defining traits (however loosely) are impossible to do as things currently stand. There is no computer infrastructure or system that can collect and store the amount of data needed to generate and operate real time 3D rendered experiences that provide a globally distributed user base numbering in the billions the ability to engage in commerce and communication. Each aspect of it has an unique set of problems that prevent the current group of companies and organizations from meeting the expectations of the consumers of the world. These problems lie across a variety of disciplines and fields. They require innovation in software and hardware. Some of the issues might be hard stopped by the laws of natural science. Others are simply due to our own societal constraints. The point is that everything we&amp;rsquo;ve outlined so far is merely theory and turning theory to reality is a much larger leap than some would have you believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the idea of the interoperable network. It’s not hyperbole to say that the internet is a modern miracle. Most of what makes it a miracle is not the technologies necessarily, but the coordination and alignment of humans across the world to create and agree upon the protocols that make up what is the “Internet”. These protocols include things like file types, the TCP/IP suite, and other standards that act as the glue that keeps the networks communicating in the same manner. Getting people to agree and coordinate on most things is insanely complex. To do it again for what would eventually be the Metaverse would once again require the type of coordinated work that most people would call miraculous. The issue is the splintered state of the systems that are being used to develop the Metaverse today. There are a variety of rendering engines, file formats, and isolated standards that need to be aligned in order to create interoperability. Anyone that has worked with any sort of team within a larger environment knows that this kind of coordination is uhhhh difficult. The massively scaled aspect of things also presents a lot of challenges. These were hinted at above, but the general gist is that serving the global population in a digital capacity requires enormous amounts of physical resources and infrastructure build out that would also need to solve some of the current issues plaguing the Internet (not all of us are terminally online just yet). Then there is persistence, which requires the massive amounts of compute infrastructure we mentioned already. This infrastructure must enable high bandwidth, low latency, and a continuous connection to the source server. As I have frequently mentioned, there is nothing available to consumers that can do even some of these things at a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IF IT&amp;rsquo;S NOT HERE NOW WHEN WILL IT BE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so at this point I think I’ve painted a picture of what the Metaverse is and what makes it actually hard to develop. The Metaverse is not here and does not appear to be happening soon. So, assuming it can happen (which is not a given), when will it happen?
Well as most consultants will tell you…it depends. On a lot of things. These things include human factors as well as technological ones. So it’s tough to say. But if we speak at a high level from a timeline perspective (again like most consultants will tell you), I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that we are speaking in decades, not financial quarters. The tough pill to swallow is that there may not even be solutions to the things that stand in the way of this coming to pass. It will require breakthroughs in hardware like wearables, headsets, and all the other subcomponents that will make up the devices we use to access the Metaverse. We will need to reach levels of coordination and standardization that we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen since the Internet arrived. We will also need to improve access to key foundational infrastructure in order to provide the level of connectivity that the 3D worlds of the Metaverse require to spring to life. There are so many things we have to get right at the right time with the right people. The bar might simply be too high.
This is not inherently a bad thing, unless you recently made a big time bet on this bar not being too high and in some ways, answer to a group of people who think in financial quarters, not decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY WAS THERE SO MUCH HYPE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason there was so much hype is because humans love to hype up new things. Especially new technologies. This is not on its face a bad thing. Our optimism is what leads to breakthroughs. You believe in something that does not exist but you think it should exist and try to will it into existence through your effort and others. These efforts tend to follow patterns of iterative progress exploding into exponential results. These patterns can be thought of as cycles or waves. The recent ones that have led to “disruption” are (as every VC will tell you) the mobile revolution, or the shift to the cloud. Being at the top of these cycles can make people very rich. So, people are always on the hunt for the next one (see crypto). The problem is that these cycles can easily just be fads. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to find the starting point of the wave. It&amp;rsquo;s several little steps that appear to turn into a giant leap and it&amp;rsquo;s tough to see which step turns into the jump. Some people are in this race for the next cycle for individual riches. Others face existential risk if they don&amp;rsquo;t find this cycle (hello God King). In a world where your strengths have been kneecapped (see Apple and mobile ads) and you are beholden to those very kneecappers on another part of your stack (guess which devices allow Facebook the app to exist in your hands), finding this next shift is the only thing that will allow them to survive and thrive. So yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s in a lot of people&amp;rsquo;s best (financial) interests to be optimistic about the Metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT CAN WE TAKE AWAY FROM THIS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the Metaverse isn&amp;rsquo;t here because it is very hard to build (shocker). In fact, we are still at the point where the thing itself is hard to define (even though we did our best). Looking at all the different things that need to go right, It probably won&amp;rsquo;t be here anytime soon. But, I do think it will be here at some point. I also think the definition will likely shift by certain degrees, but that Ball really got the heart of it with his definition. General ideas to learn from this? Don&amp;rsquo;t just see what other players are doing and copy them for no reason (Chief Metaverse Officers anyone?). Innovation is great and trying to push for the next break through is what we should all strive for, but it is important not to jump on the bandwagon for the sake of it. Do the research. Read about the underlying pieces that will make up the whole. In the end, we will see which bets succeed and which ones don&amp;rsquo;t. But at least for now, we can move on to the next (hype) cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streamlit is a really sick open source python framework that (frankly) saved my life. Founded in 2018, it&amp;rsquo;s a relatively new player in a space that honestly really needed something like this. It lets python developers create sleek data apps (aka mostly data viz // science focused web apps). While the python world has had flask and django and all these other frameworks and libraries, they were not nearly as developer friendly. The key thing about it all is that the &amp;ldquo;developer&amp;rdquo; in the case of Streamlit can mean so many types of users, as opposed to the other frameworks. Streamlit is so intuitive that data scientists, analysts, or even an enthusiastic PM can pick it up and get value out of it with a much kinder learning curve than flask or something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streamlit&amp;rsquo;s key values focus on speed and interactivity. The concepts behind the framework are all about embracing scripting and the idea of widgets to add interactivity (i.e. a widget for a file uploader vs a widget for a calendar picker). In short, it takes everything that a python developer is already used to and adds a layer of front end capabilities that are simple to adopt and powerful when used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going further, I want to give a huge s/o to Tyler Richards (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tylerjrichards&#34;&gt;@ tylerjrichards&lt;/a&gt;), the author of the great book, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-Streamlit-Data-Science/dp/180056550X&#34;&gt;Getting Started with Streamlit for Data Science&lt;/a&gt;. He&amp;rsquo;s the one that originally put me on to the framework (I saw his tweets) and a great data scientist. His book is the best place to get started if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning how to use Streamlit and I cannot recommend it enough (Disclaimer: he is my friend).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that said, I&amp;rsquo;ll jump into the actual Streamlit things I wanted to put out into the void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;brief-overview&#34;&gt;Brief Overview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 10 months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on an ML project focused on extracting text from source images and transforming that text into a final file format based on some client requirements. During the course of this project, we ran into a snag with the final step of taking the output of the text extraction algorithm and shaping it into valid format for final delivery. Everything around this project is fairly private for some NDA reasons, so this post won&amp;rsquo;t focus on much of the ML part of it. HOWEVER, what I can (and do ) want to chat about is how we fixed that particular snag in the project&amp;hellip;..Enter Streamlit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;projects-ive-done&#34;&gt;Projects I&amp;rsquo;ve done&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sample JSON to XML parser and validator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned above that the project that kickstarted my interest in Streamlit is relatively private, so I can&amp;rsquo;t really show off the application I developed (the data and requirements pretty much would give away the project context and that&amp;rsquo;s no bueno). However, I can show off a simplified version using (made up) data that is v different than the actual project and focus on some of the techniques I used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main goal was to create a user interface where a user could load some JSON files, see the data in the files + edit if needed, then form an XML that would be validated against an accompanying XSD file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type=&#34;application/javascript&#34; src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dverasc/5bb53d84560645b2e62800acb7f2cfed.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the hard work during the actual project I mentioned in the intro was the data wrangling and cleaning needed before final client delivery, mostly due to the variety of conditions and transformations the source data needed. On the flip side, this demo&amp;rsquo;s focus is all the other stuff I needed my app to do and how Streamlit allowed me to easily create these other parts that would otherwise require an actual front end developer and some javascript to do (file uploading, presentation of the data, prompts for user input, etc). The fact that I was able to get those aspects of the application set up quickly allowed me to focus on the really hard aspects, which like I mentioned, was the business logic and data transformations that the client requirements specified. Streamlit literally saved me so much time and effort that I am now &lt;strong&gt;fully streamlit pilled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/parser.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interactive Dashboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the application mentioned above is not really meant for analysis (in the end its just a cool data wrangler and parser), Streamlit really thrives in the analysis and data viz space so I wanted to demo some of those capabilities as well. With that in mind, I built a self service interactive dashboard that illustrates some data discovery and analysis on a data source I found online. The data source can be found here, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alphavantage.co/&#34;&gt;https://www.alphavantage.co/&lt;/a&gt; and is an easy and free API that provides stock data by different categories (daily, weekly, etc). To use this source, you just have to register and receive an API key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first page of the app is very basic, using csv files that a user can upload to analyze certain data points around a specific stock. You can see the strength of the framework in just this first page, with a very small amount of code giving us some powerful capabilities off the jump (multi-page application, file uploading, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type=&#34;application/javascript&#34; src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dverasc/d2b22a5eeec11d439b6dce80adb801ae.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/SimpleAnalytics.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is still fairly basic. The second page builds on that a little bit more and queries an API as a data source as well as providing some interactivity for self service analysis. On this advanced page, a user can search for the company&amp;rsquo;s ticker symbol, see a result of the most likely results, and choose from those. Once the user has chosen the company they&amp;rsquo;re interested, they&amp;rsquo;re given the option of which data point they&amp;rsquo;d specifically like to visualize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type=&#34;application/javascript&#34; src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dverasc/f3d02fb81103cad77f9aa95a3ab4a28a.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/InteractiveAnalytics.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploying with Docker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I also included a quick write up on deploying a Streamlit project with Docker (including my docker file since I know that&amp;rsquo;s what everyone googling Streamlit Docker is really looking for). While Streamlit offers their product, Streamlit Cloud, for easy deployments, my particular project needed an alternative for deployment. I ended up using Docker since that&amp;rsquo;s my go-to for just about anything and was quite happy with how easy it was to deploy. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in creating a CI/CD pipeline for a Streamlit project, you can combine this Dockerfile with Github Actions (like in one of my previous posts).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ethereum, The Merge, and how software development is hard</title>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: I own zero cryptocurrencies. I am a &amp;ldquo;no-coin *****&amp;rdquo;.
With that disclaimer out of the way, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about crypto!
More specifically though, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at one of the biggest events in the wasteland of tech, Ethereum&amp;rsquo;s transition from proof of work to proof of stake aka The Merge. However, this take will not come from the perspective of the blockchain, cryptocurrencies, or anything very technical, but instead at how development teams work together.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;DISCLAIMER: I own zero cryptocurrencies. I am a &amp;ldquo;no-coin *****&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that disclaimer out of the way, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about crypto!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically though, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at one of the biggest events in the wasteland of tech, Ethereum&amp;rsquo;s transition from proof of work to proof of stake aka The Merge. However, this take will not come from the perspective of the blockchain, cryptocurrencies, or anything very technical, but instead at how development teams work together. A lot has been said about the what and the why of this event, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been struck by the how. Specifically, how these developers from all over the world (who don&amp;rsquo;t work for the same company or organization mind you) managed to pull of such a complex feat on what is basically a world wide production build WITH ECOSYSTEMS BUILT ON TOP. Basically, making software things is hard usually because of people (not the technology itself), so what this team // collection of teams did is honestly insane when you really think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW IS THIS HARD FOR ANYBODY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software development in a team is hard. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s too crazy of a take. Now, some of you might say &amp;ldquo;learning how to code is easier than it&amp;rsquo;s ever been&amp;rdquo; or that no-code platforms make software easy enough for anybody to create or something something Github Co-Pilot or some other reply that doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually negate what I&amp;rsquo;m saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the information to learn how to write software code more accessible than it&amp;rsquo;s ever been? Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there now more tools for developers including AI to help you write code? Also, yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it now possible for people to collaborate across physical and time constraints to an almost comical extent? Also, also, yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of this takes away from the fact that software development from the perspective of teams working together is extremly hard. We have entire cottage industries and cults dedicated to the one way to make this easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of Agile? Scrum? Waterfall?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume you&amp;rsquo;ve also maybe heard some of the discourse around working from home? Perhaps the middle managers screeching about how teams must be in the same room at the same time to &amp;ldquo;foster creativity&amp;rdquo;. Or the individual contributors yelling back about how productivity is up actually and that they can&amp;rsquo;t hear them over the sound of their kids in the background. (Disclaimer: I am on the side of remote work&amp;hellip;middle managers are silly)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that making software things together with other people is hard. And it&amp;rsquo;s not an exact science (as seen by the fact that there is no one perfect answer or method). There&amp;rsquo;s an art to it. Communicating between people is hard, collaborating even more so. Think about literally any group project you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been a part of. There&amp;rsquo;s always a natural tendency to slide into entropy (it is really easy to not work well in a team is what I&amp;rsquo;m saying). So with that point hammered home. Let&amp;rsquo;s move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW IS THIS HARD FOR REMOTE DISTRIBUTED TEAMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so at this point, everyone gets it right? Software development in a team is hard, as a general rule. Drilling down even further into the specific case of remote teams, we can see that there&amp;rsquo;s even more issues specific to the case of people working remotely together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the obvious: scheduling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, not too challenging right? When can we all sit down for x amount of time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the lovely idea of timezones comes into play. While this is not always the case for a remote team, in the case of the team that implemented the Merge, it is applicable. The team was composed of people from all over the world. One woman&amp;rsquo;s 3 PM is another one&amp;rsquo;s 3 AM (or something like that). The point is, after a certain amount of people (let&amp;rsquo;s say n+5), scheduling is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the next issues are the tools used to work together as a distributed team. Now, there are definitely some great ones out there. Github &amp;amp; Gitlab, Miro, Google docs, Discord and a slew of others are quite good. But then there&amp;rsquo;s the not so good ones (whichever one popped into your head when reading that is the one I mean). And while not always showstoppers, tools that make already hard things even harder are like not good (yep, that&amp;rsquo;s my official stance on that). So not only are you working to schedule everything&amp;hellip;there is a good chance you&amp;rsquo;re also troubleshooting the very things that will allow you to do the thing that you are trying to schedule so that you can then do the actual thing you want to do. So that sucks (again, that&amp;rsquo;s my official stance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working remotely opens up its own can of worms as noted above. Making a hard thing&amp;hellip;potentially even harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW IS THIS HARD FOR REMOTE DISTRIBUTED TEAMS WHO ARE NOT LEGALLY NOR CONTRACTUALLY TEAMMATES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the section above might not seem like a big deal right? Scheduling, fixing Microsoft teams, etc is not like the hardest obstacles in the world. I tend to agree. After all, for all its negatives, working remotely beats having to arrange for a team of people stationed all over the world to come into the same physical space. The complication comes when we look at the people side of things. Specifically, the relationships, incentives, and other factors that play into how people work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think its too bold to say that it is easier to work with someone who is legally, contractually, and like explicitly your teammate // coworker. You are inclined to be collaborative since you are literally being given a salary, company resources, and other incentives (i.e promotion) to do so. Your goals (for the most part) are aligned. You want your teammate to succeed, so the team can succeed, so the project can succeed, so the company can succeed so they can in turn, give you more salary and so goes the lovely flywheel of employment in a capitalist system. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m not saying this always happens (I am quite aware of the intricacies of politics inside corporations and how different teams can be antagonistic even if they are part of the same org), but for the most part, it works better than the other scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That scenario is the one that the Ethereum teams found themselves in. What is the alternative to working with only your legally and fiscally mandated teammates? Well, working with teams from other orgs. This can be seen when a company hires consultants or a contractor works alongside an in-house team. This can also be seen when two companies partner on a joint venture or initiative. This can also happen when your public project is governed by a variety of factions and individuals with wildly different priorities, incentives, and goals. To give you an idea of what I mean, here&amp;rsquo;s an unofficial look at the different parties involved in the Merge and the wider Ethereum ecosystem (note: there were literally hundreds of developers that played a role in this multi-year project so this is by no means comprehensive):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitalik (I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have to expand on who he is) &amp;amp; The Ethereum Foundation (as the nominal stewards of the community, they have a large amount of teams that contributed to the shift to proof of stake)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ConsenSys (one of the factions from the original launch of Ethereum and a major team in the space, one of their researchers published a paper in 2020 on what ended up becoming the mechanisms behind the Merge and they continued to actively contribute at a code and leadership level)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prysmatic Labs (a team originating from Prysm, one of Ethereum’s most popular software clients, their developers have been recognized for their importance in the PoS shift and its implications in the wider ecosystem)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ChainSafe (another firm with deep relevance in the ecosystem, one of their projects plays a pivotal piece as a validator in the new proof of stake model)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SigmaPrime (similar story as ChainSafe, one of their projects is a client that plays a key role for the concept of &amp;ldquo;consensus&amp;rdquo; in Ethereum)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethereum Cat Herders (a group dedicated to supporting all those involved in the project by taking care of project management, coordiantion, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, each of these groups represent a rather large amount of teams and developers that led to such a large base of contributors. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe they were all the best of friends with perfectly aligned processes, methodologies and general ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW IS THIS HARD FOR REMOTE DISTRIBUTED TEAMS WHO ARE NOT LEGALLY NOR CONTRACTUALLY TEAMMATES WHO CONTRIBUTE TO A WORLD WIDE ACTIVE NETWORK OF USERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so I think at this point we might be getting an idea of the difficulty of software development by teams at this scale. From the get go, software development is hard. It can be even harder in teams that are sitting in different places on our lovely planet. It is even harder when these teams are made up of a multitude of organizations, individuals, and interests that are not contractually enforced or governed by a central legal authority.  I&amp;rsquo;m about to mention another wrinkle in all this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project they were working on is a globally de-centralized programmatic platform with communities, businesses, and other protocols built on top of it and relying on it to exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about the ramifications of what I said earlier. What happens if you fail in one feature or commit? Boom! there goes entire companies that are now dead in the water since their business relies on the platform you just messed up on. I mean, the amount of pressure is immense when you put it into perspective and unlike other projects, the safety net of centralized responsibility and governance is gone. It is literally like building the rocket ship as you fly it&amp;hellip;except it&amp;rsquo;s more like a flying city with a signifcant amount of people relying on you not to royally f*** up the building of the thing otherwise they uhhh will be very very very not happy and likely out of a job, money, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW DID THE MERGE ACTUALLY HAPPEN THEN IF ITS SO F@@@&lt;em&gt;@&lt;/em&gt;@ HARD TO DO THIS STUFF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading about the inside baseball and the anecdotes from those who were active in the project or who spoke with contributors, a couple things jumped out to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the various factions and items were not part of the same company or contractually considered teammates, their interests were aligned due to an almost reverent desire to make this go well (another hot take: the crypto community has a tendency to create zealots) and because for most of them, the success of the project was inherently existential (i.e. their products, communities, etc relied on it going well to surive)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willingness to adapt: every single piece that I read mentioned how people were willing to meet at odd hours or off days. If all parties involved are willing to make concessions when it comes to coordinating things, things go a lot smoother. I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t like being the one that gets up really early or stays on really late, but if everyone takes turns having to be the one willing to sacrifice, it can make it go a lot easier. This goes past scheduling. Willingness to adapt to a particular tool or organizational style or anything else really seems to be a key factor in the success of the project. It signals the intent to collaborate and meet others halfaway. Some could call that earning trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variety of plans of attack: there was no one set path forward. While the original idea for the how to make the merge happen from a technology perspective was published and all the technical aspects had to be agree upon and executed, there was no concrete roadmap created on Day 1 and followed to the letter. It was an evolving plan that had to be adapted and reshaped and reexamined, continually. While teams worked in traditional project formats (formal sprints with stands ups and all the usual agile side stuff), they were also hosting hackathons, workshops, and IRL meet-ups. They were having debates and publishing papers and sharing knowledge through non traditional means. I imagine that the nontraditional events and nature of the plan helped create some sort of bonding between all the parties as well as helped foster a wide variety of contributions that may not have come from doing things the modern, traditional, sdlc type of way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I picked up on a general vibe from all the people involved in the work: a larger mission. For some, it was the mission of &amp;ldquo;Ethereum&amp;rdquo; aka the continual growth and development of the technology because it was the future of society and financial systems (see zealots). For others, it was a desire to rectify a key weakness in the platform, its energy use and effect on the environment (see climate change). For others, it was their magnus opus, their scream into the void, their greatest work, etc etc (see the futility of human life and our attempts at a legacy). The mission might not have been exactly the same&amp;hellip;but they all had one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll notice I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention a specific set of tools or technologies when looking at how they managed to get it done. Everything I mentioned was a people thing, not a technology thing. At the end of the day, the hardest things in tech tend to be those that deal with people and their interactions. Something I&amp;rsquo;ve found in my experience and from researching this project is that for people to go the extra mile for one another, it has to go beyond contracts or money. There needs to be higher purpose to the work because that is what gets people through the hard moments. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of ways to mitigate the issues that arise in distributed software development (IRL meet-ups, rotation of duties, staggered schedules, asynch knowledge transfer), but to truly get the hard things done, people need a mission to strive for. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying everyone should frame work as &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;re saving the world&amp;rdquo;, but we should definitely try to find the higher level values and drivers that motivate people to work well together and strive for more than just the basics. It could be as simple as &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;re all trying to get this done so that we can make enough money to live without financial stress and enjoy life outside of work&amp;rdquo;. That may not be as inspiring as revolutionizing the global financial system, but a mission that everyone aligns with and can use to drive them forward might be the only true way to make the hard things of software development a little bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;p&gt;Once again, instead of new writing I&amp;rsquo;m posting an old essay from undergrad. This time the focus was AI [buzzword gang]. Once again, there is a real sense of naiveness to the thoughts expressed here, but my caveat continues to be that I had zero experience in the field at the time of writing and also I was 19. Anyway, here is my slightly naive and silly take on AI in (what was then) the present and the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence is an emerging and disruptive technology that has been identified as the next great shift in society and production. Society for the most part treats this new field with fear and apprehension. Both the general public and the world’s top minds are divided over the direction artificial intelligence will take and whether it will change the world or end it. Although there is no consensus on the direction this technology will take, the key to landing on the same page as a population will be to educate and spread information in order to help society come to terms with this new stage of innovation and enable leaders to make considerate and deliberate decisions. The purpose of this paper is to educate and enhance the understanding of artificial intelligence and analyze its potential for positive and negative consequences in society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence and Society: Today and in The Future
“The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race&amp;hellip;. It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn&amp;rsquo;t compete, and would be superseded.” This is not a line from a sci-fi thriller or a post-apocalyptic novel but a quote from Dr. Stephen Hawking, who is generally considered a pretty smart guy. This remark is just one of many from several of the world’s greatest minds who are concerned with the potential threat that artificial intelligence poses on the world and this sentiment is mirrored in the general public, where most people’s first thoughts on AI and its development always revolve around the danger it poses to individuals and society. This reaction stems from the fact that humanity has always feared what it doesn’t understand. However, every emerging technology always has potential for both positive and negative consequences, and the purpose of this paper is to expand on what AI actually is while enhancing the analysis towards its potential for positive impacts and negative effects on society.
To fully understand the potential that AI poses, it is important to examine its history . The idea of intelligent and autonomous machines has existed in fiction for decades but the term “artificial intelligence” itself was officially stated by John McCarthy in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference. That same year, two scientists revealed the first running AI program, which was named the “Logical Theorist”. By 1997, the Deep Blue Chess program defeated the world chess champion at the time, Garry Kasparove (AI Topics, n.d.). It was around this time period that the general public began to truly acknowledge the deep power that machines possessed due to the mass realization that a person at the top of their field had had been bested in a human game by a program.
History and current events tend to show a trend in relation to innovation, particularly in terms of technology. This trend (known in the technical world as Moore’s Law) is generally stated as an exponential growth in computing power with a dramatic decrease in costs (Intel, n.d.). The technology surrounding artificial intelligence is no exception to this trend and that can be easily seen when looking at the speed at which this field has expanded. In today’s world, artificial intelligence has grown so developed that it can actually be broken down into 3 sub-categories, which are hierarchical in terms of power and autonomy. These categories are artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), artificial general intelligence (AGI), and artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) (briefly described in Figure 1.1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial narrow intelligence is the base level of artificial intelligence computing, and utilizes machine learning to focus on performing one particular function at the level of human intelligence (McCelland, 2017). A great example of this is the chess program that beat Kasparove, Deep Blue. This machine was excellent at chess, but not much else. Machine learning is at its core the use of algorithms to analyze large amounts of data, learn, and then find trends and predict outcomes without being explicitly told what to look for (Thompson, Li, Bolen, n.d.) . The easiest way to think of this level of intelligence is to rank it in terms of human input. At this level of intelligence, the machine can learn and anticipate but it still requires higher level of human input to point them in the right direction and provide the data that it needs to extrapolate conclusions and results. More recent examples of advanced systems at this tier include AlphaGo, a program designed to play the the Chinese game Go, one of the oldest games in human history. This game also happens to contain more possible board configurations than the number of atoms in the known universe. In 2016, AlphaGo managed to beat the world Go champion and arguably best player in history, Lee Se-dol. AlphaGo utilizes machine learning in the same logic as Deep Blue, but it uses neural networks and streamlined architecture to teach itself exponentially as it plays (DeepMind, n.d.). Programs like AlphaGo are examples of the power narrow intelligence possesses when compared to the human mind. One of the most overlooked characteristics of artificial narrow intelligence is its wide spread use. Most of the general public does not recognize many of today’s systems and machines as ANI driven, yet some of the most common applications in our day to day life such as search engines, virtual assistants, and even video games all fall into the category of narrow intelligence (Westerheide, 2017).
. The underlying foundation of ANI is machine learning, a concept touched on earlier. Machine learning has evolved over the years in accordance to humanity&amp;rsquo;s increased technological and financial advances. The early days of machine learning can be identified to be in the 1950s, when Arthur Samuel wrote the first computer learning program with a purpose of playing checkers and the system getting better in every iteration (Medium, 2017). For the following decades, machine learning and the algorithms at the heart of the systems continued to increase in complexity. By the 1990s, machine learning was being used for professional applied functions and included a major break through in the logic used to create systems with the ability to learn. This shift took the approach from being knowledge-driven and shifted to the data-driven approach that constitutes modern machine learning. This switch in methodology along with higher computing power has allowed AI systems to advance to applications on a more complex scale. The narrow AI systems of today learn through a process that provides a start state, based on the universe in which the problem exists, and the specific goal, and then letting the learning process system figure out the intermediate states and how to progress from one state to the next. The states and transitions are developed with the use of statistics and big data (Drepper, 2017). Today’s society quietly revolves around the wide spread use of AI in every day life and this helps to balance out the fear and hesitancy that society has attached to artificial intelligence.
The next tier of AI is artificial general intelligence, which is cutting-edge today. Most projects close to reaching this level are engines similar to Google’s DeepMind. Artificial general intelligence is defined by the AGI Society as &amp;ldquo;a general-purpose system with intelligence comparable to that of the human mind (and perhaps ultimately well beyond human general intelligence)&amp;rdquo;. The key difference between AGI and ANI is the scope and width of their ability to process at human like levels or above. Reaching the true levels of artificial general intelligence is the goal in today’s intelligence community, but it is not exactly here yet. The engines closest to general intelligence use a technique called deep learning to perform cross-domain tasks. Deep learning uses neural networks with layers of processing power to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data. Some examples of the way AGI is currently being used include image and speech recognition, which are the engines that drive the highest level of data analytics and virtual interactions with people.
Although true artificial general intelligence does not currently exist to the fullest extent, the concepts that will help us achieve it are being put in place within many of the most prominent AI engines in the industry. Deep learning is the next level as far as machine learning and is integral for today’s systems. It is the logical strategy being utilized in order to approach general intelligence in machines. Deep learning utilizes algorithms that are inspired and derived from the system of neural networks within the human brain. When describing this method of learning, renowned computer scientist Yoshua Bengio described systems being able to “learn feature hierarchies with features from higher levels of the hierarchy formed by the composition of lower level features. Automatically learning features at multiple levels of abstraction allow a system to learn complex functions mapping the input to the output directly from data, without depending completely on human-crafted features.” Using this process, systems with general intelligence will be able to solve issues across all areas that would typically require a human brain.
Past the first two categories in this field lies artificial super intelligence, which is exactly what it sounds like. There is currently no system capable of operating at this capacity, although there are some scientists that see it coming within 65 years or so (Müller, Bostrom, 2014.). The most basic way to think of a machine that would be in this category is a system that can perform any function in any domain at a level far higher than even the greatest human mind could attempt. Any ASI system would need to incorporate the concept of “Theory of Mind” which is essentially the comprehension that other entities in the world can have thoughts and emotions that affect their own behavior (&lt;a href=&#34;https://theconversation.com/understanding-the-four-types-of-ai-from-reactive-robots-to-self-aware-beings-67616)&#34;&gt;https://theconversation.com/understanding-the-four-types-of-ai-from-reactive-robots-to-self-aware-beings-67616)&lt;/a&gt;. In layman’s terms, a machine would have to achieve self-awareness. This is the level of intelligence that is often depicted as the fall of society in popular culture. There are currently 2 school of thoughts in regards to how this level of technology will be achieved. The first group believes that the key lies in advances in machine learning and projected hardware innovation, they place their beliefs in the idea that a breakthrough in the current methodology will help us reach super intelligence. On the other hand, there is another group who believe that the key lies in the human brain itself, their school of thought is directed at replicating the structure and logic of the human brain using far deeper and more complex neural networks and applying the concept of the binary firing that neurons in the human brain utilize (Harvard Science Review, 2015). Once operational, a system with ASI would essentially become the lead researcher within the field of artificial intelligence because it would be able to create its own AI systems at a far faster rate than humanity could. It remains to be seen exactly how we will reach super intelligence, but it is clear that a system of this scope would be more powerful than anything we have seen before.
Artificial super intelligence would be a paradigm shifter due to the fact that it would be able to create on an exponential scale and this would signal a new era in production. Human history can be broken down into periods dominated by a certain type of machine and the technology that powered those machines. The initial period encompasses the 18th century, which was the first Industrial Revolution and used steam-based machines. Following this, the second industrial revolution began in the 19th century and continued through the 20th century and was dominated by electrical and energy-based mass production. Then the first information revolution occurred and this was in the late 20th century. The first information revolution operated using computer and internet-based knowledge, which is how we view the world today. With the introduction of AI however, the next projected stage is the 2nd information revolution and this phase is what we are currently working towards. We are still not confident in exactly what this next stage will consist of or how society will be affected, but we are in the midst of answering those questions. Figure 2.1 depicts a visualization of these stages in society.
Figure 2.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific community is currently at odds over when the exact arrival time of artificial super intelligence, but they all agree that it is still reasonable enough to start discussing the ethics and morality surrounding this exciting field. Like you’d expect, the idea of ASI systems is very polarizing amongst the general public but also with some of the world’s top minds as shown below by Figure 3.1
Figure 3.1
*Results come from “Future Progress in Artificial Intelligence: A Survey of Expert Opinion” by Müller, Vincent C. and Bostrom, Nick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most publicized sentiment in this debate is the idea that super intelligence will be the end of humanity and the society we recognize today (the existential catastrophe bit in Figure 2.1). The prevailing sentiment within this camp was summed up nicely by Elon Musk when he said that AI is “our greatest existential threat.” A large part of the reason that this general fear
exists stems from pop culture’s depiction of AI in scenarios such as Terminator and countless sci-fi movies and novels. Once a system of this level were to be activated, it is more than likely that we would not get a chance to turn it off due to its potential as a dominant learning machine. Stephen Hawking himself remarked that he thought “the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.” Movements to get ahead of this potential threat have been growing in accordance to the general sense of foreboding and warning messages. When Google purchased the DeepMind system, part of the contract stipulated that a joint AI Ethics board be formed. In a similar vein, tech leader such as Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and others have joined efforts to create a research-driven safe AI group, OpenAI. The specific functions of this enterprise are somewhat vague (it is an emerging technology after all), but the purpose is clear; to work for safer artificial intelligence and push for pro active legislation (Dowd, 2017).
The current fears in the artificial intelligence community are based on the idea that a super intelligent system would be too powerful to even try to fight. When experts are pressed on their views of how a system could end humanity, the response tends to be quite varied. One researcher, Eliezer Yudkowski elaborated on several possible scenarios of how AI could best humanity, including a possibility of a system being able to “solve the science technology of predicting protein structure from DNA information”. This scenario doesn’t seem too frightening until Yudkowski’s narrative concludes with the system creating “tiny invisible synthetic bacteria made of diamond, with tiny onboard computers, hiding inside your bloodstream and everyone else’s. And then, simultaneously, they release one microgram of botulinum toxin. Everyone just falls over dead.” This is just one of many paths that a malevolent super intelligent machine could take, but the underlying message is consistent; we must get ASI right the first time, because there is only a very slim chance that we will get a second attempt.
The other side of this divide sees artificial intelligence as the next logical step in innovation and something to pursued relentlessly. A majority of the world’s leaders in creation and advancement including Google and Facebook are at the heart of this movement. Mark Zuckerberg actually directly downplayed Musk’s concerns by saying “Some people fear-monger about how A.I. is a huge danger, but that seems far-fetched to me and much less likely than disasters due to widespread disease, violence, etc.”  The long-term plan for some in this school of thought is an integration of biological intelligence and artificial intelligence in order to reach a higher level of society. This may sound far-fetched, yet for many experts it is the expected extension of today’s society. When confronted with fears from their opposing peers, the justification that ASG supporters use is essentially that it is the next step in society’s growth whether we like it or not. There is almost a sense of inevitability amongst those immersed in this field, a type of confirmation bias that may cloud their views on the potential negative effects of artificial super intelligence on society.
There is a justification for the fervent desire that the supporters of this group have for pushing the envelope when it comes to artificial intelligence. Even with just narrow intelligence, the benefits that AI can provide to general society are hard to argue with. The field of big data has become pivotal to the way businesses run and markets expand and this industry is driven by AI engines that analyze large clusters of consumer data and allow decision makers to create
connections and reach conclusions. Other examples of narrow AI being applied towards benefiting general society include fraud detection and cyber security, automated vehicles, and virtual assistants such as Apple’s Siri. Past these common applications, there are even more powerful applications for the higher levels of artificial intelligence. The engines that are approaching AGI in today’s society are being used for visual and auditory recognition, developing mechanical prototypes, and analyzing systems in industries ranging from finance to health care. Looking to the future, there are researchers who hypothesize that the solutions to some of the most difficult challenges facing humanity such as climate change and resource shortages will be resolved using the higher levels of AI in the future. There is no doubt that artificial intelligence has the potential to change the way the world operates for the better due to its sheer power and ability to connect information at the highest speed.
Overall, artificial intelligence presents an exciting opportunity for humanity and society in many different ways. There are currently several different levels of AI, with differing levels of computing power and complexity. These levels are recognized as Artificial Narrow Intelligence, Artificial General Intelligence, and Artificial Super Intelligence. We are currently only scratching the surface of these systems, but we are nearing the point when regulations must start coming into the picture. The dilemma that is currently raging is a division between two groups. The first is those who would work slower and proactively regulate in order to mitigate risk, with another faction who believes in stepping forward and pushing the envelope towards reaching the vision of super intelligence at the fastest rate possible. With no clear answers in today’s climate, the only proper approach is to continue to invent and create with AI researcher Altman’s words of caution to temper us, “The next few decades we are either going to head toward self-destruction or toward human descendants eventually colonizing the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>draft: true
This is more of a shout into the void about thoughts that have been kicking around my brain recently. If they are not good thoughts, well, then don&amp;rsquo;t read them.
Games, growth, and ZIRP
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a quick glossary of terms:

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on in my journey with the Techno Wizard in the Lucasverse (Wayspire, Arcvale, you know the lot), I remember chatting with a group about the gaming and tech industry, the failures we had seen in it, and the type of things we would build in its place (if we had the chance). I remember distinctly during that conversation that the entire group was aligned on building something that was focused on sustainable growth with an emphasis on control by the people building it and you know, (actual profit). This was right at the last, massive, ambitious, short sighted, beautiful gasp of the ZIRP era. The glory of crypto, the Uber Eatsification of mobile, the sheer blind faith of the Metaverse. What a time. Anyway, these days everyone is talking about startups valuing control over infinite injections of outside capital (and dilution), prioritizing profits over projected growth, disbanning skunk works divisons etc. On one hand, I think it’s easier to make that decision when the insane valuations are no longer on the table. On the other hand, can’t take too much credit from our side of things. We were a group of industry friends on Discord making fun projects and opining on the scars we had gathered in said industry. We weren’t a startup, or a nonprofit, or an agency, or anything that we ended up becoming. We were just a small fish in a big pond trying to figure out if we even liked the water. Basically, we were nobodies, outsiders, etc. It’s pretty easy to take on a contrarian approach in a world that uh doesn’t really care what you think of it. I didn’t have the words for it back then, but being unknown (and broke) was a gift because it allowed us to move without fear of loss (there wasn’t much to lose!) and to identify that we wanted to play an infinite game, not a finite one. We lucked into identifying the game we wanted to play really early on. Many businesses, organizations, and people never realize what game they are playing (or what game they want to play).&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted in a bit and instead of actually writing, I found some old papers from undergrad that I will simply repost. The first one is on VR and its social applications for an emerging technologies class (looking at you Jim Moran). I found my old drive of files back then and wanted to post it and see how it stands up 5 years later (post META pivot of course). I&amp;rsquo;m posting the original paper with no edits, but I do want to acknowledge some of the content and how it has aged (poorly in some cases &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;). I have a section covering the idea of VR as an &amp;ldquo;empathy machine&amp;rdquo; and talk about an experience that simulates assault at a party. While at the time the research wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly very in-depth, more has come out lately that points to some potential issues with these &amp;ldquo;in their shoes&amp;rdquo; experiences and its applications (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/19/virtual-reality-sexual-harassment-training/)&#34;&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/19/virtual-reality-sexual-harassment-training/)&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, I was definitely more optimistic (some might say naive) about virtual reality and its potential but this was before I had any serious experience in the field or anything of the sort. I think I got like a decent grade on it but this was for a business technology class, not any hard science or research based class so don&amp;rsquo;t expect a thesis on human machine interaction. Anyway, feel free to read below and judge my 19 year old self&amp;rsquo;s misplaced confidence in VR [WELCOME TO THE METAVERSE BABY]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual Reality in Society: The State of VR and its Social Applications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego Veras&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida State University&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual reality is an emerging technology that has been identified for its potential in industries such as gaming, entertainment, and research. Society for the most part is still not informed on virtual reality and the technology behind it and so they tend to pigeonhole it as a gimmick or extension of video games. The purpose of this paper is to show that virtual reality’s most powerful applications are actually in the field of social reform and elaborate on those possible uses. Society is at a point in history where we face challenges as whole that we have never encountered before. Our lack of solutions and progress forward has created hostility, frustration, and held us back from advancing towards a better world. Research from sources across industries has shown that virtual reality is the key to progress due to its uses as an empathy machine, educational tool, and therapeutic aid. The hope is that by shedding light on the powerful applications for this technology, society will embrace the technology and continue to pursue a brighter future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual Reality in Society: The State of VR and its Social Applications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 2014, developer and engineer Michael Abrash joined Oculus and stated that “Virtual reality is the Final Platform - the platform to end all platforms.” When analyzing the changes in society and technology, one can’t help but come to the same conclusion. Once the reality of virtual reality sinks in (pun not intended), the seemingly infinite applications for this technology start to flash across most people’s minds and typically this includes entertainment, gaming, and even real estate. However, the true power behind virtual reality lies in its potential to impact social reform. For the first time in history, it is literally possible to walk a mile in someone’s shoes and in the midst of social unrest, virtual reality has the potential to be used as an empathy machine, a platform for education, and as a therapeutic aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the world of virtual reality and VR technology, a foundation of knowledge must be established. As with most disruptive technology, the general public is still only aware of virtual reality through flashes of online content and headlines. However, the origins of the concept and technology trace back farther than most people think, starting in 1938 when a French collection of essays used the term “la realite virtuelle”, in reference to the nature of objects and illusions. This phrase unsurprisingly translates to “virtual reality” (Artaud, Le Theatre et son doble) and is the first published use of the term. The idea of a separate reality continued to snowball from the early origins and development of the 1930s onto the height of the science fiction craze in the 70s and 80s. Amongst this wave of technological fiction, novels such as “Pygmalion’s Spectacles”, “Neuromancer”, and “Snow Crash” stood out due to their vision of what society and humanity would be like in the future with the application of virtual reality. As the idea of virtual reality started to spark inside the minds of some, the technology that could bring it to life began to emerge and catch up with our imaginations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 20th century, fiction began to inspire the world’s minds and the first physical prototypes were formed. In 1960, Morton Heilig invented what is considered the first head mounted display (HMD). This headset was called the Telesphere Mask (Virtual Reality Society, n.d.) and although it lacked the motion tracking of its descendants, it did feature stereoscopic 3D and wide vision with stereo sound. Just a year later, the first motion tracking HMD was built and was implemented for military applications. As time passed, each iteration of headsets and hardware began to advance more and more and the virtual reality industry began to form its identity. By the 21st century, the key players had carved out their niche and created the headsets and programs we recognize today, including the Oculus Rift, Google’s Cardboard, and Sony’s PlayStation VR (details on current hardware can be found in Table 1.1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/TABLE1-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table 1.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside the hardware advancements of the past decades, the software and imaging behind VR programming has continued to grow and advance almost exponentially. The original programs from the early days were very simple, with military simulations and films used as the experience inside the headsets. As time has passed, the programming has increased in complexity and diversity, and today’s VR software ranges from interactive games, to architectural and real estate experiences, and even entire worlds created by developers where people can interact with one another in real time, no matter the distance. The explosion in VR software development has been forecasted by the projected market size for VR technology around the world and points to even more advanced development and programming in the near future (Figure 1.1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point in history, the real power of virtual reality is just being uncovered. Most people naturally point at the gaming industry when they think of possible applications, but as we begin to implement the technology in our lives, people will finally be able to grasp the possibilities this new platform holds. Amongst the most potentially impactful applications lies in the use of virtual reality as an “empathy machine”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more and more social issues rise in our inter-connected world, the saying “put yourself in someone else’s shoes” starts to weigh heavy. We live in the most connected time period in history, and yet we cannot seem to push past these social conflicts that keep setting us back. Virtual reality grants us the opportunity to turn a phrase into a tool to improve the world we live in. The logic is very simple, the execution even more so. Due to the advancements in technology today, when a person slips into virtual reality, the majority of their stimuli comes from the virtual program, not the outside world. This sounds straight forward, but when this occurs, the mind and body are tricked into believing this new reality. When the program is a Ping-Pong game, virtual reality just appears to be a gimmick for the tech savvy. But when the Ping-Pong game is replaced with a live scene from warfare in the Middle East, the gimmick stops and the power of this technology sinks in. Immersion leads to true engagement, and this engagement is the key to increasing empathy amongst people all over the world.
There are several programs and companies today that are aiming to push this “empathy machine” use of virtual reality and although the pool size for feedback is small, research continues to expand and point towards a real effect on those who experience full immersion in these situations. A great example of the power that immersion in virtual reality truly possesses comes from a VR film that was released at the Sundance Music Festival in 2015. Created by Rose Troche and Morris May, the film takes you through two perspectives. Set in a college party, the film begins with the perspective of the male and alternates with the perspective of the female. Sounds straight forward enough, but the experience takes a turn for the worse when an innocent meeting at a party begins to progress into a harrowing experience that 1 in 5 female college students go through. In the end, the perspective of the female wakes up after being assaulted, full of confusion and with a message left on her leg with pen, “You are fun.” Sounds extreme, but the power of virtual reality is that it truly puts you in the place of the man, who initially just looks like a normal college student trying to hit it off with a girl, but as the night progresses his decisions stray from normal to criminal, which shows the user how easily things can go wrong. Although its hard to quantify the data that came from the release in 2015, those who experienced the film were left crying, shaken, and moved to take action against campus assault (Specular Theory, 2015). Other similar immersive films include experiences in the middle of Syrian warfare, police brutality situations, and political marches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, virtual reality won’t end all the problems that arise as society continues its march forward into the future. However, this new medium that VR technology has created will be critical in shifting cultural differences and addressing societal problems. As was said earlier, we are now able to literally step into another’s shoes and see the world and experience it in ways that were impossible before. This is a new frontier in social change, and now more than ever, we will need to use this empathy machine to face challenges together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward past the idea of an empathy machine, virtual reality as a technology can also be applied for social change as a platform for the advancement of education. Education as a whole hasn’t improved drastically in decades, which in any other field is unthinkable. Stagnation kills, and the only way society can advance is to embrace the potential of VR and education. The first and most obvious educational application for virtual reality is field trips. An example of this is can be seen in Virginia, where the Arlington Science Focus School uses the Oculus Rift to take students on field trips to places such as the Amazon river, where students can literally be immersed in the forest and still learn due to the ingrained educational text that appear as students approach a particular animal or fauna (Babcock, 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential in integrating virtual reality and education is most noticeable when analyzing the learning styles of students. As shown by Figure 2.1, students all have different preferences when it comes to how they learn best and the struggle in the modern educational system appears to be how to cater to the diverse ways that humans learn. Virtual Reality essentially helps to merge the learning styles and provide a full experience that combines verbal, visual, auditory, and tactile methods of education. Further more, the possible programs that can be developed for virtual reality in education are as infinite as the amount of knowledge that exists in the world. Programs like the Virtual Human Interaction Lab at Stanford are already taking advantage of VR and using the technology to educate people on subjects like climate change, physics, and resource conservation (Virtual Human Interaction Lab, n.d.). People can experiment with dangerous chemicals with no fear of actual damage when they are inside a VR chemistry lab, or practice heart surgery before stepping into an actual operating room, or experience the Renaissance in person as they learn how the modern world developed. We are on the cusp of revolutionizing learning and education, which will only be catalyst for positive change in the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: Diablo Valley College and 4faculty.org&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third application for virtual reality and social change is the use of VR technology for therapeutic purposes. Research shows that mental health issues are consistently increasing across the population and society has not found an effective way to counter this epidemic. Mental health issues are so widespread that about 20% of people in the U.S. have a diagnosable mental disorder (Insel, 2015). This is where virtual reality can step in and make strides towards turning the tide against mental illness. Examples of methods of VR therapy include remote tele therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and immersive therapy (Senson, 2016). To elaborate on some of those methods, consider cognitive behavioral therapy and immersive therapy. The logic behind those two methods revolves around exposing patients to those triggers or factors that create anxiety, depression, or stress. However, this method has always been limited by the lack of safety and inconvenience of exposing patients who have extreme fears or dangerous stressors. Virtual reality allows medical professionals to expose their patients to those triggers and objects of fear in a safe and controlled environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For proven therapeutic results, one only needs to look at the effectiveness of VR therapy when dealing with patients that suffer from PTSD, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder develops after exposure to trauma and plagues around 24.4 million Americans today, and innumerable others worldwide (PTSD united, n.d.). Virtual reality has been used to tackle this disease since the 90s and studies have shown that it is just as effective as drug therapy with some studies even putting it above drug therapy (Senson, 2016). Countless testimonies have been published from those who were able to surpass their trauma thanks to the integration of immersive therapy and virtual reality and it is not unreasonable to believe that this technology will be successful in helping those who suffer from other mental illnesses as well. Mental illness is continually on the rise and has been a tough opponent for society to defeat, but the application of virtual reality in therapeutic techniques will give us a chance at fighting back and helping those who are suffering in silence all across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Society today is facing challenges that it has never come across. Now more than ever we need something to shift the paradigm and virtual reality presents us with the opportunity to overcome those challenges that continue to plague us. Although there are many applications and uses for the technology, there are some that can be used for social reform and positive change and they include using virtual reality technology as an empathy machine, an educational platform, and for therapeutic purposes. Society needs solutions and virtual reality might just be the one we need because as Bill Gates said, “We are all created equal in the virtual world and we can use this equality to help address some of the sociological problems that society has yet to solve in the physical world.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction--devops&#34;&gt;Introduction &amp;amp; DevOps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arcvale.com&#34;&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve&lt;/a&gt; been working on a three tier web application with a js front ent (sveltekit) &amp;amp; golang backend (GraphQL) and have containerized both. Early in development, we did manual deployments since it was a small team hacking together a starting prototype. As the product strategy &amp;amp; design developed, we started looking for ways to increase our development speed and practices and a natural point to improve was our deployment process (or lack thereof). With that in mind, I realized we needed to take advantage of the containerized nature of our application and the fact that we already had other projects running on DigitalOcean, so support was not an issue. The rest of this piece will go over the different parts of the CI/CD pipeline, but at a high level, the pipeline is based on Gitbub Actions with scripts to ssh into our DigitalOcean droplet, clean the resources &amp;amp; build a Docker inage, &amp;amp; then run the image, all in an automated fashion after a developer pushes into the main branch (look at all those buzzwords).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is DevOps? Basically, in the giant constellation of cults and schools of thoughts in technology (you know Agile, Scrum, etc), there is a relatively new player called DevOps. This new school is focused on how the people that write the code (dev) and the people who launch // deploy the code work (ops) work together. While this is a somewhat simplistic definition, it&amp;rsquo;s really the main idea. There tends to be a lot of friction and handoffs that happens in teams that are building digital products and since our brains are always trying to OPTIMIZE, DevOps rose to address a lot of that friction. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot that goes into the specific rules and artifacts and etc, but it all starts with an attitude &amp;amp; desire to improve the transition between code to shipping with a focus on automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;cicd&#34;&gt;CI/CD&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay DevOps makes sense I think&amp;hellip;but&amp;hellip;then&amp;hellip;.what is CI/CD?
Glad you asked! One of the core pillars of DevOps is the concept of CI (Continous Integration) &amp;amp; CD (Continous Deployment), hence CI/CD. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it breaks down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CI: this is the part of integrating the different branches and versions of code into the &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; branch or whatever is considered the centralized, most up to date, source of truth version of the code. This is typically done by some variation of comitting, pushing, reviwewing and is associated with things like pull &amp;amp; merge requests, Github, Gitlab, and general chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CD: this is the part of deploying the most up to date version of the code to whatever environment is considered the final stage that end users interact with. This involves testing code and making sure that it will not break or destroy the product that end users are using. There are many variations and best practices on how different teams do this, but all deployment practices consist of automated testing &amp;amp; usually involve some interplay with either on-prem servers or a cloud provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When teams integrate CI/CD into their practices, release cycles tend to speed up and overall shipping cadence improves.
CI/CD is one of the pillars behind schools of thoughts and best practices surrouding DevOps, Cloud-Native development, &amp;amp; Agile software development. Different teams have different components, but proper DevOps adoption tends to lead to a CI/CD pipeline, which is the end-to-end system with all the different components that make up its steps to integrate and deploy application code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;digital-ocean&#34;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this particular use case, the cloud provider is DigitalOcean. While DigitalOcean isn&amp;rsquo;t one of the big 3 cloud platforms (Google, Azure, or AWS), it offers a better user experience built with developers in mind. They don&amp;rsquo;t offer the full portfolio of services like the big 3, but they have everything anyone needs to build a web application with very solid documentation and ease of use. Basically, they get you what you need for most situations, have transparent pricing, and you won&amp;rsquo;t end up smashing the screen at the UX of it all. I&amp;rsquo;m a fan and the application this piece is based on is currently running on a Digital Ocean droplet [NOTE: they didn&amp;rsquo;t pay me to say nice things about them, but they should&amp;hellip;hit my line DigitalOcean].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;github-actions&#34;&gt;Github Actions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub Actions is a feature offered by Github that allows you to create a CI/CD pipeline based on config files, but with a nice user interface that plays well with other Github features like depoyment keys and secrets for information like passwords and user creds. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with Azure DevOps before, and while Actions isn&amp;rsquo;t as comprehensive (not that I blame them for it, I mean its feature vs platform here), I did note a similar interface from a GUI perspective which felt familiar to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-pipeline&#34;&gt;The Pipeline&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipeline starts with a push to a Github repo that contains the code, which then activates the Actions script to run, ssh into our DigitalOcean server, and run several Docker commands that will build and deploy our containerized application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-setup&#34;&gt;The SetUp&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple components must be set for the scrip to be able to run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) You will need to set Github secrets for your ssh server credentials (in this case, Username, Key, and IP)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Github Secrets are encrypted environment variables that are encrypted before they reach [Github] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/sealed_boxes)&#34;&gt;https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/sealed_boxes)&lt;/a&gt;. You can set them up by clicking on the Settings tab for the repo that is storing your application code and looking on the left hand menu for the Secrets section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/secrets.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can set up secrets at the repo level&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B) After setting up the secrets, you are going to need to activate Github Actions and add the script from the section below to run the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similar to secrets, you can configure the actions by finding the Actions tab on the same repo top level menu that has the Settings tab. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve landed on the secrets page, you&amp;rsquo;re gonna click &amp;lsquo;set up a workflow yourself&amp;rsquo; in order to create your own actions script (aka the one you&amp;rsquo;ll copy and paste from here).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/actions.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;you&amp;rsquo;re gonna click &amp;lsquo;set up a workflow yourself&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C) Once you&amp;rsquo;ve hit set up workflow yourself, Github will take you to a new file being created within your project structure called &amp;lsquo;main.yml&amp;rsquo; (this is the file you&amp;rsquo;ll be editing the script into)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/actionsyml.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;this is the file you&amp;rsquo;ll be editing the script into&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-script-what-youre-here-for&#34;&gt;The Script (what you&amp;rsquo;re here for)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script below will do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSH into your DigitalOcean server using the IP, Username, and Key variables you&amp;rsquo;ve stored as environment variables (NOTE: you can use the root user for this but you should NOT..instead create a new user in your server with ssh priviliges and use those creds instead)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in, script will navigate to your project directory and pull for changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After updating the code files in the directory, it will clean the current resources, and build the new, latest image&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will then deploy // run &amp;amp; publish a container based on the most up to date image build&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  name: CI

      # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job

          username: ${{ secrets.HOST_USERNAME }}
          key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}
          script: cd ~/directory &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git pull 

      # build docker container
      - name: Docker Build
          uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
          with:
          host: ${{ secrets.HOST_IP }}
          username: ${{ secrets.HOST_USERNAME }}
          key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}
          script: cd ~/directory &amp;amp;&amp;amp; docker rm containername -f &amp;amp;&amp;amp; docker build --platform linux/amd64 --no-cache -t appname .

      # run docker container
      - name: Docker Build
          uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
          with:
          host: ${{ secrets.HOST_IP }}
          username: ${{ secrets.HOST_USERNAME }}
          key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}
          script: cd ~/directory &amp;amp;&amp;amp; docker run --restart=always --publish 3000:3000 --name=appname -d appname
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;final-gui--conclusion&#34;&gt;Final GUI &amp;amp; Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the script is comitted, this should trigger the first run of your pipeline with the following interface allowing you to control the pipeline and find out status and other data points on your runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/mainactions.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main Actions Screen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/drilldownactions.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drill Down into Run&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that pretty much wraps up the pipeline. This could work on other cloud providers or on-prem since we&amp;rsquo;re essentially just ssh-ing into servers, but the cool thing about &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marketplace?category=&amp;amp;query=&amp;amp;type=actions&amp;amp;verification=&#34;&gt;Github Actions&lt;/a&gt; is that there are template for all sorts of use cases and platforms for deployments, so there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance that someone has already covered a stack and has posted a config file for it. The important bits here are the general concepts and ideas behind CI/CD and building a practical pipeline for small // prototype projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>EdTech Products &amp;amp; Analytics Some time last year, I read a research paper called Dashboard stories: How narratives told by predictive analytics reconfigure roles, risk, and sociality in education (s/o to Juliane Jarke &amp;amp; Felicitas Macgilchrist as they are the original researchers and authors of the paper). I wrote a whole end of course paper on the research so I could go into a lot more detail, but I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it relatively high-level on this for the sake of all our attention spans.</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;edtech-products--analytics&#34;&gt;EdTech Products &amp;amp; Analytics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time last year, I read a research paper called &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20539517211025561&#34;&gt;Dashboard stories: How narratives told by predictive analytics reconfigure roles, risk, and sociality in education&lt;/a&gt; (s/o to Juliane Jarke &amp;amp; Felicitas Macgilchrist as they are the original researchers and authors of the paper). I wrote a whole end of course paper on the research so I could go into a lot more detail, but I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it relatively high-level on this for the sake of all our attention spans. The purpose of the research was to gauge the impact of predictive analytics on how teachers make decisions (framed through a focus on data dashboards with ML available to them through a variety of edtech products). This paper has haunted me a little bit over the last couple months as I&amp;rsquo;ve spent time building products and seeing other products be built in the edtech space and I felt like venting into the void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thesis is that there are specific narratives &amp;amp; stories that are “written” by predictive analytics and consequently, into the dashboards that are produced, which then alter the behavior of teachers and students. These dashboards and products shift the teacher role to resemble a manager, which in turn, shift the framing of a student’s actions &amp;amp; potential to that of interactions that are “machine-readable”. To me, this seems related to the overall trend of &amp;ldquo;Silicon Valley best practices&amp;rdquo; spreading everywhere and the collective obsession modern business seems to have with FAANG culture &amp;amp; &amp;ldquo;data science&amp;rdquo; (note: I love a good dashboard as much as the next guy, but not everything needs to be tracked and fed into a model i.e. the educational system and the complex graph of interactions that make up its foundation). One could argue that this trend has even reached the other side of our educational system, parents and the home (see The Atlantic Piece with the all time quote, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/families-slack-asana/593584/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Perhaps one’s children and direct reports are not so different after all.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;). I guess my general take on this phenomenon is: data is not neutral, so the implementation of data analytics into an aspect of society is not inherently a good thing, and doing so blindly is such a giant cop-out of agency and a grand example of indeterminate optimism (&amp;ldquo;ML/data science/analytics dashboard is the future of education&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; techno yoga-babble instead of idk actual investment and interest in building out our country&amp;rsquo;s educational system at the local and federal level being the future.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the paper goes on to expand on dashboards as storytelling devices with two main narratives taking place. The first narrative deals with risk. If we conclude that predictive analytics and the dashboards shift the teacher into a “manager” role, then it stands to reason that as managers, they are being pointed towards seeing risk as a key dimension in the classroom and their interactions with students. Anyone that has managed a project of any kind knows that risk is something that has to be considered and measured, so this pivot in the role of teachers makes sense intuitively. Thing is, risk dashboards only show correlation, but the narrative nature of how humans interpret the data (humans love stories) shown in dashboards emphasizes causal connections, which leads to faulty conclusions that correlation is the same as causation from a behavioral perspective (big no no). The other narrative is about sociality. Sociality is a dimension that can be measured in predictive analytics but unfortunately, the nature of data at this point in time means that sociality can only be measured from “in-tech” interactions. This means that the only data points used to analyze sociality in students come from digital communication (discussion boards, comments, etc). Once again, anyone that has been assigned a discussion board knows that being measured solely on a db post as your &amp;ldquo;sociality&amp;rdquo; dimension is not a good representation of your true sociality (&amp;ldquo;Good evening xxx, Great post! I definitely agree with blah blah blah&amp;rdquo; at 11:55 PM before your initial post is due). This constraint leads to interactions in the physical classroom to be under measured when drawing conclusions about student behavior and participation. The conclusion of the paper finds that the constraints involved in predictive analytics and dashboards in the education space can lead to a “narrow understanding of individually measurable education” (shocker) and can render the external, structural inequalities invisible and thus not considered when teachers try to turn dashboard insights into action. In english&amp;hellip;.not all of education or life is digital, and measuring those complex aspects of life &amp;amp; society through the lens of only the digital interactions &amp;amp; inputs that can be modeled through software is extremely limiting and big NOT GOOD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that in mind, let&amp;rsquo;s turn to the world of tech conferences. Recently, I attended a certain edtech conference that was A) gigantic and really cool but also B) full of products and vendors with DASHBOARDS &amp;amp; CLASSROOM ANALYTICS &amp;amp; MACHINE LEARNING and it just really struck me how much we&amp;rsquo;ve deferred to Tableau and D3 and python and all the buzzwords in the world instead of taking risks and exploring new ways to create technology for the actual purpose of education (not tracking, but like you know passing on knowledge and preparing the future of our society). As tech has risen as the Industry and its quirks and sins and general THOUGHT LEADERSHIP have spread, I fear we&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten what technology can be: a catalyst for rapid change and transfomation that has yet to be matched. We don&amp;rsquo;t need programs that track users across browsers or log keystrokes or any of the surveillance mechanisms we seem to implant into every product and feature list. We need products that can reach more students at a higher quality both in-person &amp;amp; remotely, expand access to actual broadband &amp;amp; high speed internet, add to our teachers&#39; natural abilities, and enrich students&amp;rsquo;s experiences, not just track // document them. As a builder of these things, I can only do my bit to create products that respect the balance between the analog and digital components that make up a healthy life but also I can have my scream into the void, which is this piece. Please stop tracking keystrokes and start trying to teach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past articles in this case study, we went over the source systems and the middleware that comprise the data pipeline. Now we’ll discuss the destination components and how they communicate with the other parts to make up the end-to-end pipeline and complete the event-driven design. These components are the message broker, the consumer service, and the destination database (MongoDB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;message-queues--brokers&#34;&gt;Message Queues &amp;amp; Brokers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Message queues have been defined as “a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architecture”. In less buzz wordy terms, it’s a software component that acts as a hub for messages from a source (also known as a producer) to a destination (also known as a consumer). Instead of one system sending data directly to another, this acts as a middle man of sorts. This “decoupling” of software components is a core part of the modern system design for cloud based software and applications. Something to note is the concept of asynchronous communication, which is really any sort of communication that includes sending someone a message and not expecting an immediate response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are different variations of queues and how they handle messages (first in, first out as an example), for this particular guide we’ll talk about RabbitMQ. RabbitMQ, or just Rabbit, is an open-source message broker. A message broker is a variation of the concept of a message queue, still acting as a middle-man in the transfer of messages, but including capabilities like parallel processing from multiple consumers, transformation of the data/messages. It can help translate between different messaging protocols, as opposed to just sending it back and forth with no manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to its open-source nature, you can use RabbitMQ locally and on the cloud without having to pay for anything other than compute resources to host on the cloud. Rabbit can be deployed using Docker, Kubernetes, or just by downloading it on your machine, (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)&#34;&gt;https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)&lt;/a&gt;. A popular alternative is Apache Kafka, which has its own pros and cons, and can also be deployed using Docker or by installing it locally. Kafka is usually compared to a queuing system such as RabbitMQ. What makes the difference is that after consuming the log, Kafka doesn’t delete it. In that way, messages stay in Kafka longer, and they can be replayed. Rabbit uses a pub/sub pattern, with consumers “subscribing” to a particular topic and Rabbit “pushing” the information to the consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;consumer--destination-database&#34;&gt;Consumer &amp;amp; Destination Database&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The queue needs somewhere to send the message that it receives. This is where the consumer comes in. A consumer is any piece of software that communicates with the queue or the broker, and does something with the data that it receives. Typically a micro-service, this software can be written in your preferred language, although in our case we wrote it in Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our solution concluded with a microservice written in Go that acted as a consumer, cleaned the data up, and upserted into a MongoDB cluster. I’ve included some snippets from the consumer we developed to help demonstrate the basic parts of this part of the system (connect to the queue, get the message data, and finally send it to the database). It should be noted that our production code was different due to the unique data manipulation that the client needed and the amount of messages we needed to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also worthwhile to mention my assumption as a writer that the reader knows the basics of Go so I won’t spend time talking too much about the intricacies of the language and the development environment (that is a different post entirely).&lt;/p&gt;

            fmt.Printf(&amp;quot;\nMessage Count: %d, Message Body: %s\n&amp;quot;, msgCount, d.Body)
            //here we&#39;re essentially &amp;quot;mapping&amp;quot; (unmarshaling) the content of the message to the struct we declared above
            err := json.Unmarshal(d.Body, &amp;amp;messagestruct)
            if err != nil {
                fmt.Println(&amp;quot;Error unmarshaling message body to message struct&amp;quot;, err)
            }
            result, err := CRUDdb.InsertOne(ctx, messagestruct)
            if err != nil {
                fmt.Println(&amp;quot;Error Inserting Document ----&amp;gt; &amp;quot;, err)
            }
            fmt.Println(&amp;quot;Here is the create result &amp;quot;, result)

        }
    }()

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this second block of code, we’re connecting to the Mongo database instance and giving it a ping just to make sure we connected successfully. Then, we enter into a go routine to handle the messages using threads in case there’s a large amount of data in the queue (see multi-threading if you need more info around the concept). In this go routine, we unmarshal the body of the message into our struct so that it can be represented in both JSON and BSON (need this data representation in order to insert into the database).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context, MongoDB is a document based database (see NoSQL) that manages data not in tables or rows, but in essentially JSON-based format (i.e. BSON). Data is represented as key/value pairs, and is inherently more flexible than traditional SQL databases due to its lack of an enforced schema. It is important to note that in production, we utilized the upsert capability of MongoDB, which inserts data only if the database doesn’t find that the document already exists in the records. We used upsert because our production system is moving changed data, so we want to make sure that we only update the documents that have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on this particular project was exciting due to the many different services and software we implemented. From working on serverless functions to document based databases, this pipeline had a bit of everything (and it also optimized for cost &amp;amp; performance, which is the goal at the end of the day). I’ve included a visual of the entire system from beginning to end and its components, which I also included in the original post of this series, way back when. If you read this whole thing, I appreciate it and I hope you got something useful out of it. If neither of those things are true, then that’s okay too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous entry, I went over the source systems including Microsoft Dynamics and the database that sits under it. Due to it being 2021 and the cloud eating the world, the source systems were deployed on the Azure cloud and as such were easily configured to interact with certain services that we designed to transfer the data from the source to the message queue. Specifically, these services were Azure Logic Apps, Azure functions, and finally blob storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;azure-logic-apps&#34;&gt;Azure Logic Apps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Azure Logic Application service is offered on the Azure cloud and its billed as a “Integration Platform as a Service”, or in slightly different terms, it is a workflow engine used to tie together different Azure services. Some of the pros include the fact that it’s a visual interface (think “no-code”) and the sheer ease of combining a variety of Azure’s cloud services. It is analogous to the Step Functions on AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the workflow that we developed on our logic application at a high level is to automatically run the export jobs on the Dynamics application and place the files generated from the jobs on Azure’s storage system. While it was not particularly difficult to create this workflow from a technical perspective as it is a no code solution, there were some tricks and quirks that we learned that are useful to share to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;azure-logic-workflow&#34;&gt;Azure Logic Workflow&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of our particular process was to establish the cadence or scheduling of the logic app. The application offers several configuration options as far as scheduling goes, and for the sake of this guide, I’ll include a screenshot of what it looks like set to run every eight hours (see below)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/DII-I.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the recurrence has been set and the schedule configured, the next step is to initialize the variable that the workflow is going to use to represent the export job’s reference ID for each specific run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/DII-II.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The step that follows encompass the bulk of activities, and is held within a isolated series of events, in a section called “Scope”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/DII-III.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This self-contained block of logic within the scope called “Until” is the segment that runs the export job on Dynamics. This is illustrated below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breakdown of these steps is essentially saying until the value that is returned by the “Dynamics Export to Package” job is not that string of zeros (which represents completion or not), then the logic app should run the “Dynamics Export to Package” job. The fields that can be configured for the “Execute Action” substep include the Instance (which Microsoft Dynamics application is this workflow controlling), the Action (in our use case, we were exporting to a data package hence the action shown in the image), the Definition Group ID (the name of the export job running on Dynamics), whether it should re-execute on failure, and the Legal Entity ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the export job is run, the logic app will then return a value. This value will be used further in the workflow to run other steps. One important thing to note at this stage is that there may be a slight delay in the export job running and the logic app returning the value, so I added a five minute delay in the app following the Export to Package job to give the systems time to align (shown below):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/DII-V.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in the workflow, the logic app has triggered the job run and has stored the return value. This return value will be used to validate the next step in the workflow, since it represents the job’s execution ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the five minutes have passed, the next step of the workflow is set up to take the data files created by the jobs and place them into an Azure blob directory. The first part of this block of logic is a condition that is essentially asking “Is the execution ID that was declared in the beginning of the entire application the same as the value returned by Dynamics after the job was run?” (see below)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/DII-VI.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is False, then we configured the application to send an email notifying our support team that there was a failure in the process (shown below)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/DII-VII.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However if this is True (which means the job ran successfully), then there is another isolated block of logic that is responsible for getting the files and placing them in the Azure blob storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the block of logic that references the True condition, we added another sub-condition as control to the Dynamics operation that would gather the files produced by the earlier Export to Package job. This sub-condition is essentially asking if the Export to Package job succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the job succeeds, then the logic app will execute the Dynamics action that gathers the URL of the data package (the result of the job Export job). This URL is used to place the data into Azure blob storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting the URL, the block of logic adds another sub-condition. This piece of conditional logic is to verify that the URL is https and thus, valid (shown below)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/DII-VIII.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling down into the True section of logic, the HTTP module of the logic app is used to call a ‘GET’ method on the URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTTP block then gets to create the blob that will store the files. However, here’s one of the quirks of the Azure environment. The files created as part of the Export to Package job are all stored as one blob, which means that they appear as one object on Azure’s storage service. This is quite limiting if you have a job that exports multiple entities and would like to save each entity’s data file as a separate object. The solution to this issue is to add another step after creating the blob to “extract” the files to stand alone blobs (shown below)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracting the single blob object (Azure detects it as an archive) to a new directory dumps the individual files into the path that you set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Azure Logic App service is quite powerful, and the fact that we could orchestrate an entire data extract process with no lines of code written is a testament to that capability. While there are some odd bits of knowledge needed to get this particular workflow set up, it speaks to the Azure ecosystem that we integrated so many parts of the puzzle so easily. The next section will deal with what the pipeline does with the files after they are dumped into the blob storage service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;azure-functions&#34;&gt;Azure Functions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s Azure Functions are the cloud provider’s serverless compute service. For some brief context, most major cloud providers provide a “serverless” offering that allows users the highest level of granularity when it comes to computing. Essentially, serverless computing allows developers to run code without having to provision servers, configure a back-end or hosting solution, or managing runtime. Microsoft’s Azure functions provide this through an event-driven platform that allows for programming in a variety of languages (C#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, Python, TypeScript, Other/Go/Rust). This article will show code samples in Python, but we did also experiment with developing custom handlers for Go (our follow up to this guide could include those examples). Serverless code is only billed for the seconds or less of runtime of each function and can be a economically efficient solution for the right use case (code should be stateless, etc). One of the main advantages of Azure Functions is the integrated local environment provided through Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code. You can test, debug, and deploy your function code all in one, well-designed interface. The goal for our function is to get the data from the files in blob storage, transform it, and send it to the messenger queue that feeds into the destination database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;setting-up-azure-functions-on-vs-studio-code&#34;&gt;Setting Up Azure Functions on VS Studio Code&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t typically use VS Studio Code, then….well I apologize because this entire section operates under the assumption that you are developing on that IDE. I’m sure there’s other ways to do it, but this guide will not be showing those. This guide also assumes that you have an existing Azure account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up VS Studio Code is relatively easy. The first step is downloading the Azure Functions extension to your IDE (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/DII-VVI.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/DII-VVII.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the function is installed, you should now see the Azure icon on your side menu (if you don’t see the icon, you may have to close and re-open the VS Studio Code application)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/DII-VVIII.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the extension is installed, the next step is to “Create New Project”. After you’ve pressed this button, the IDE will present a series of configuration prompts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- What language do you want to use for the function project (Python)
- What function template (Blob Trigger)
- Level of Authorization (Function)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once these are set, you should have an Azure Function project ready to edit on your VS Studio Code window with the following generated files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- hosts.json
- local.settings.json
- requirements.txt
- A folder that contains the function.json definition file and __init__.py file for the code
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;blob-trigger&#34;&gt;Blob Trigger&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our particular system, we needed our code to run whenever files are dropped into a specific directory. Since this is one of the most common use cases for the Azure Functions, the generated &lt;em&gt;init&lt;/em&gt;.py comes with pre-configured code to begin the function. This code includes the pre-configured binding to the blob storage service. The code shown in this section will include some of the pre-configured bindings and some additional ones, which will require changes in various of the files in the projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import csv
import sys
import logging
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
from azure.storage.blob import BlobClient
from azure.storage.blob import ContainerClient
import azure.functions as func
import pika
import os
import json
import pandas
from reader import Reader
from io import StringIO, BytesIO
import pyxlsb
import openpyxl
import requests

def main (myblob: func.InputStream, msg: func.Out[func.QueueMessage], inputblob: func.InputStream):
    # dblob = myblob
    logging.info(f&amp;quot;Python blob trigger function processed blob \n&amp;quot;
             f&amp;quot;Name: {myblob.name}\n&amp;quot;
             f&amp;quot;Blob Size: {myblob.length} bytes&amp;quot;)`
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this initial section of the code, we import all the packages that we need to take the data from the files and send it to the queue. It’s important to note that all packages being imported into the function need to be reflected in the “requirements.txt” file (see screen shot below):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/DII-VVIV.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next part of the project files is the bindings that the function uses. While the template blob trigger comes with the binding for the blob storage trigger, our function also includes bindings for the message that we will be sending to our queue and for data in the blob that is triggering the function run. These bindings are reflected in the “function.json” file of our project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each binding has certain values that reference the information in the “local.settings.json” file. For example, the field “connection” should reference a value in the “local.settings.json” that provides the connection URL value (see below):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/DII-VVV.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: When deploying to production, all the values in the local.settings.json file need to be added as “Application Settings” to the Azure Function configuration in the Function App service&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/DII-VVVI.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your bindings are set, you can now write the logic of the function code. While parts of the function we used in our system are either not relevant to the article or cannot be displayed because of client confidentiality, there are some things I want to highlight that can be useful for most general use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;name = myblob.name
    print(name)
    if &amp;quot;.csv&amp;quot; in name:
        #      # Convert blob to json
        conn_str = os.environ[&#39;nameofstorageconnectionvariable&#39;]
        container = os.environ[&amp;quot;nameofcontainernamevariable&amp;quot;]
        blob_name = myblob.name.split(&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;,1)[-1]
        container_client = ContainerClient.from_connection_string( conn_str=conn_str, 
        container_name=container)
        downloaded_blob = container_client.download_blob(blob_name)
        df = pandas.read_csv(StringIO(downloaded_blob.content_as_text()), sep=&#39;,&#39;, engine=&amp;quot;python&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above lines of code are used to access the content of the file that was uploaded to blob storage and triggered this particular function. The connection string and storage container are stored as environment variables, and need to be set to access the storage service. This produces a container client, which has a method to download the blob object itself. It’s important to note that the blob name should be formatted (I used split), in order to use it to download the blob. If the blob name is not formatted, it can throw an error when trying to use that name to download the blob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this use case, the next step in the pipeline is a message queue. To insert the contents of the blob file into the queue, the Azure function needed to transform the downloaded content into JSON. This requires first using the Pandas package to create a dataframe from the blob csv file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I knew the file was going to be a csv, I called the read_csv method. If you’re handling excel files or something similar, pandas has methods that work in the same manner as read_csv. From this dataframe, the function then iterates through the rows and creates batches due to the large data size of certain data entity files. These batches are then transformed into JSON. The final condition determines the contents of the message being sent to the quee based on the file name. Once the JSON is created from the raw file data, it is then dumped into a variable that is sent to the message queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;        df = pandas.read_csv(StringIO(downloaded_blob.content_as_text()), sep=&#39;,&#39;, engine=&amp;quot;python&amp;quot;)

        index = df.index
        rowamount = len(index-1)
        print(&amp;quot;Here is the rows count ----------------&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, rowamount)

        batchdelimeter = 5000
        line = 0
        x = 1

        if batchdelimeter != 1:
            batchcounter = rowamount//batchdelimeter
            if(rowamount%batchdelimeter) !=0:
                batchcounter = batchcounter + 1
        else:
            batchcounter = rowamount
            x = 0
        print(&amp;quot;here is the batch count---------&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, batchcounter)
        for batch in range(batchcounter):
            if (batch==batchcounter):
                iter=rowamount
            else:
                iter=(x*batchdelimeter)
            x= x+1
            print(&amp;quot;starting with the batch # ----------------&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, batch)
            print(&amp;quot;the line-------&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, line)
            print(&amp;quot;the iterator------&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, iter)
            print(&amp;quot;the loc&amp;quot;, df.loc[line:iter]) 
            linerecord = df.loc[line:iter]
            print(&amp;quot;ending with the batch  # ----------------&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, batch )    
            line=iter+1
            lastflag = False
            if batch == (batchcounter - 1):
                lastflag = True
        # for line in range(batch):
            result = linerecord.to_json(orient=&#39;records&#39;)
            parsed = json.loads(result)
            dumpresults = json.dumps(parsed, indent=4)
            messagebatchcounter = batchcounter
            stringcount = str(messagebatchcounter)
            if &amp;quot;FILENAMECONDITION&amp;quot; in name:
                msg = &#39;{ INSERT JSON HERE }&#39;  
                key = &amp;quot;vendor&amp;quot;
            r = requests.post(api_url, data=msg)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our system sent the variable storing the JSON content to the message queue by calling a post method on an API that we developed in-house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bulk of this data pipeline lies in “the middleware” of the system. The Azure Logic App and Functions serverless service combined offer quite a lot of functionality and power across the Azure cloud ecosystem. Being able to integrate workflows across services and have them communicate with one another is a key advantage in the logic apps. On the other hand, the Azure functions provide a level of compute resource granularity that is hard to beat. While the functions service supports a variety of language, the handlers are configured to handle C#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, Python, and TypeScript natively. I highly recommend utilizing the VS Studio Code extension for the functions service, as its fully integrated IDE is convenient for local development and testing, and allows you to upload your code to the functions app on the cloud very easily. The next and final part of this case study will break down what happens after the files are sent to storage and the content transformed to JSON.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Introduction Recently, I worked on a client project that required us to track changes made on the client’s Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance &amp;amp; Operations module and integrate those data changes on the destination application.

      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I worked on a client project that required us to track changes made on the client’s Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance &amp;amp; Operations module and integrate those data changes on the destination application. As a team we learned quite a bit on how to design and implement a solution to this scenario and we wanted to share insights and tips for anyone needing to develop a pipeline similar to ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-stack&#34;&gt;The Stack&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project, we had a source system made up of a relational source database in MSSQL, sitting behind Microsoft Dynamics 365 and a destination system composed of a web application with a supporting database on MongoDB. The source database has a feature called “CDC”, or Change Data Capture that can be configured to track changes at the table level. In our use case, these changes needed to be captured at the MongoDB side as they happen in the SQL database. Our pipeline was designed to use an event driven architecture, using RabbitMQ as our message broker. The destination components included a consumer service subscribed to our broker’s topic, and a MongoDB cluster as the destination database where the data changes are capture. The components of the pipeline include Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and blob storage as the middleware. I’ve included a visual of the design of the system from a high level for a complete look at all the different components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/dI-I.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-articles&#34;&gt;The Articles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mirror the development process, this study will be broken into different articles, each one focused on a different layer or stack of our architecture. We will start with the source system and database (Microsoft Dynamics &amp;amp; MSSQL), followed by the middleware (Azure Logic Apps &amp;amp; Azure functions) and finally, the destination system (message broker, consumer service, and MongoDB database).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-articles-in-this-series&#34;&gt;The Articles in this series:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Part I: The Source System (see below)
Part II: The Middleware
Part III: The Destination System

&lt;p&gt;Part of the design and development process always involves a bit of research, and I wanted to both credit the sources of information that helped us during our research and also provide other resources for anyone who will be taking on projects similar to ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the sources we used during our research:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-i&#34;&gt;Part I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-source&#34;&gt;The Source&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project, our data source was the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance &amp;amp; Operations web application sitting on top of a SQL database. An important characteristic of this source is that it is a relational database, as opposed to the destination database, which is a document based database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;relational-databases&#34;&gt;Relational Databases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relational databases tend to be the industry standard for most groups and organizations because to be frank, these databases have been in place longer than the other types and have the most support amongst vendors and enterprise clients. Most developers and database admins learn their trade using relational databases, and they are the de facto standard in the industry. The key characteristics of these databases are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Database is managed by RDBMS or “Relational Database Management System”
- Data is structured in rows and columns based on pre-defined relationships
- Data can be manipulated using SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Rows represent a collection or grouping of related values
- Columns represent a certain kind of data
- Rows almost always have a “primary key”, used as an unique identifier
- Popular relational databases include MSSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;microsoft-sql-server&#34;&gt;Microsoft SQL Server&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve covered the general idea of relational databases, we will go over some of the product specific traits of SQL Server. The first thing to note is that Microsoft SQL Server and the shorter “MSSQL” acronym are interchangeable in industry, so just remember that they are one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s SQL Server is one of the most popular enterprise databases and tends to come up quite a bit on client projects (including the one that inspired this post). In the past, Microsoft wasn’t exactly “open source” friendly and using their product would have required purchasing a license key and going through the process of setting up the system as a customer. Thankfully, they have taken different attitudes in recent years and expanded their offerings to allow for easier deployments and no upfront costs for use. Due to this, if you’re following this project and don’t have access to a client’s MSSQL, you can launch an non-production MSSQL database using Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;microsoft-dynamics-365-finance--operations&#34;&gt;Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance &amp;amp; Operations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally known as Microsoft Dynamics AX, this system is focused on medium and large organizations and enterprise resource planning. Within the Dynamics ecosystem, the data that we are interested in is expressed as “Data Entities” which are essentially custom views composed of fields from the base tables. The purpose of “Data Entities” is to abstract the data from the base tables to business specific terms for non-technical users (an example could be an “Employees” entity, which could bring in fields from 4 different base tables that store information relevant to employees). For our project, the data entities that needed to be transferred from source to destination came from what is referred to as “Export Jobs”. These export jobs are created using the web interface, which provides both a layer of convenience and safety since the data does not have to be directly pulled from the database. This interface meant that we did not need to create custom queries or stored procedures to get the data out. I’ve included some images below to demonstrate the features I’m talking about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/DI-II.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ignore the red box, we’re interested in the Export button&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/DI-III.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Add Entity button allows us to configure each job with the data we are interested in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-the-source-components&#34;&gt;Setting Up the Source Components&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a technical perspective, this source system requires the least amount of work. To set up the rest of the pipeline, we simply created “Export Jobs” for all the data entities we were interested in transferring to our destination system by adding the entities to the jobs on the configuration screen. In our particular case, we configured the jobs to export the data as CSV file extracts, but it is possible to export the data as Excel extracts or other file/data types. The key requirement for our project was that we weren’t interested in exporting all the data every time, we were interested in only the data that had changed (“Change Data Capture”). To make sure we were only transferring this specific data, we made sure to enable change data tracking on every entity we were interested in. Once this was enabled, only data that changed would be exported after the first initial data dump. You can do this using the web interface, in the Entities module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dverasc.github.io/DI-IV.png&#34; alt=&#34;image alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To be clear, you should enable CDC for each entity before creating the Export Job&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;source-system-conclusion&#34;&gt;Source System Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading this section, you might be struck by the simplicity in this stage of our pipeline. Due to the abstraction that is provided by the Dynamics web application, we were saved from having to directly interact with the underlying database. To summarize what we did here, we simply enabled change tracking on the entities we are interested in transferring and then created the corresponding export jobs. In the next post, we’ll explore how we tie these export jobs into the rest of the pipeline and our event driven design using a couple different Azure services.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is Micromobility</title>

      <description>We are in the midst of transformational times. The acceleration of several trends in various sectors due to COVID-19 has created an immediate need for building new services and products that can serve the new “normal.” One of the major trends gathering momentum prior to 2020 predicted to explode post-COVID is known as “micromobility”.
Although the word is self-explanatory at face-value, the micromobility movement has historically faced some obstacles because both consumers and businesses struggle to truly define the new model of transportation.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;We are in the midst of transformational times. The acceleration of several trends in various sectors due to COVID-19 has created an immediate need for building new services and products that can serve the new “normal.” One of the major trends gathering momentum prior to 2020 predicted to explode post-COVID is known as “micromobility”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the word is self-explanatory at face-value, the micromobility movement has historically faced some obstacles because both consumers and businesses struggle to truly define the new model of transportation. Horace Dediu over at micromobility.io provided a concise definition: “micromobility is personal mobility whose utility is to move its occupant. Its purpose is thus to offer maximum freedom of mobility and its minimalism is to do so in the least impactful way. Its minimalism means it needs to leave no trace of itself and ask the least for itself.” Another, more quantitative definition is “any vehicles whose gross weight is less than 500 kg.” In other words, the defining characteristics of micromobility is that it is any form of transportation that provides maximum mobility at a micro, individual level whilst creating the most minimalist footprint of itself. That last part is what truly defines this novel sector and captures the imagination of those with an eye on the future. Ultimately, micromobility could be the key to reduce the strain on our cities, and consequently, on our world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, micromobility has also been largely defined by the simplicity and fun that its devices tend to inspire. Users don’t require any special talent to wield a micromobility device like an electric scooter, and yet at any time, one only has to spin their handle, “rev their engine,” and zoom towards their destination. These devices tend to be easy to fold away and at home, don’t take up too much space (as opposed to your car, which has a whole room dedicated to it). Most users who have adopted micromobility got their first taste of this movement by renting a device and purchased their own after experiencing both the efficiency of transportation and whimsical fun of the devices. Now that the early adopters have embraced micromobility, we are starting to see people apply these devices to more, standard, everyday use such as traveling to work or bouncing from meeting to meeting. However, it’s important to highlight that at its heart, the micromobility movement began with shared scooters, and users who simply wanted to have some fun, zoom around, and “rev their engine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a less ambiguous idea of what micromobility is, the next question is what is private micromobility? Let’s start with defining what private micromobility isn’t. It is not the rental fleets of electric scooters that have been deployed in metro areas all over the world. It is instead, the next step in the movement, which is devices like those electric scooters that are instead owned by a person, as opposed to shared and “disposable.” Currently, most people are familiar with the “disposable” scooter model mentioned above, which has been popularized by services like Lime. This is the model in which a user can locate a scooter, rent it on a mobile app, use it to transport themselves to their destination, and then leave the vehicle wherever they decide to for the next user to pick up. However, the popularity of the shared model has led to an increase in individuals purchasing their own vehicles, especially in Europe. The perfect case study for this can be found in Spain, where studies estimated 100,000 personal mobility devices in the country, with e-scooters accounting for 60% of those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does Boongaloo come in? Well, as I’m sure many of you realized as you read through the article, because the current most widespread model of micromobility is the shared, use-and-leave rentals, there is no infrastructure in place for those personal mobility devices that have begun to pop up in the hands of the private owners in European cities like Malaga. Unlike bicycles — which have a long history in European cities and are taken into consideration in discussions around infrastructure, parking areas, and development — electric scooters have little to no support. Boongaloo’s goal is to create the physical parking infrastructure for these devices, and just as crucially, create the digital and mobile systems that will allow users to get the full value of their private mobility devices, and ultimately, drive the shift towards smart cities and sustainable models for metropolitan areas.&lt;/p&gt;
