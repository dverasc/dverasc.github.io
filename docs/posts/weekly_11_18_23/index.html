<pre><code>&quot;Veras also found increasingly inventive ways to attract widespread attention to his relatively small shop, many of them centered on organizing expensive parties for founders. Indeed, one of these gatherings — an “annual” event held two years in a row at the stadium where the FSU football team plays — inspired an episode of the HBO show “Silicon Valley..&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a pretty hectic couple of months in the universe of tech, finance, and pop culture that I sort of exist in. Lot of movement in the AI space (RIP to the wrapper startups after OpenAI Dev Day) and in the world of financial fraud (I cannot tell you how many SBF youtube videos have been recommended to me by YT&rsquo;s algo). Mirroring all this activity, this edition of the list has a bit of everything&hellip;AI, fraud, and uhhh <em>checks notes</em> Nazi ads?</p>
<p>Q4 has been many things, but boring is not one of them.</p>
<p><strong>LATE ADDITION</strong></p>
<p>Sam Altman is no longer CEO of OpenAI. This was dropped at close to EOD on a Friday afternoon. Shit is going down.</p>

</ul>
<p>A) Yes I know that title is kind of rough, but its the only one I could make work with the play on words.</p>
<p>B) There were a lot of big announcements and shakeups at OpenAI&rsquo;s Dev Day earlier this month, so I could have highlighted any one (or all) of them. I chose this one in particular because it may be the most subtly important.</p>
<p>A friend and I are were talking about all of the updates that came out of that event, and he put forward that this announcement is actually one of the biggest hints as to OpenAI&rsquo;s long term strategy. I tend to agree.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we mean.</p>
<p>One of OpenAI&rsquo;s new initiatives is called &ldquo;Copyright Shield&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s basically a program where they say &ldquo;Hey if you are in legal trouble for using our products, we&rsquo;ll take care of it&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s some finer grained details (&ldquo;it only applies to “generally available” features of OpenAI’s developer platform and ChatGPT Enterprise&rdquo;) and it&rsquo;s sort of only focused on IP lawsuits and actions (so if you rob a bank and say its because ChatGPT told you to, uh I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re stepping in), but generally speaking, this is a really interesting stance that they&rsquo;re taking. It should be noted they&rsquo;re not the first company with generative AI offerings (Adobe, Getty Images, etc) to establish a program along these lines, but as the elephant in the room, it&rsquo;s definitely noteworthy that Sam and co are following this trend.</p>
<p>The question is why? After all, there&rsquo;s also other companies with gen AI offerings that have taken the opposite stance. They have policies that are the legalese equivalent of &ldquo;too bad, so sad, that&rsquo;s on you buddy&rdquo; regarding users getting in trouble for generated content from an IP perspective. One perspective is that they love their users and cannot stand to see them suffer legal trouble (and if you believe that, contact me because I have some things to sell you). Another is that they are optimizing for enterprise adoption, and enterprise customers are not signing up if they aren&rsquo;t confident that they won&rsquo;t face a lawsuit down the road for using those products. I think this is directionally correct. But as my friend and I discussed, there&rsquo;s also the perspective of this program giving them an opportunity to play an outsized role in shaping the future of the legal and policy areas of this space. Through this program, if defend enough companies and they win enough cases, they&rsquo;ll both set favorable precedents for more products down the road, <em>and</em> they&rsquo;ll also massively increase goodwill amongst developers and enterprise users. The second hand effects of these programs are interesting to think about a sort of corporate strategy or moat, sort of along the same lines as the idea of regulatory capture.</p>
<p>Oh but also, JSON mode was another cool announcement. No mas prompting an LLM with &ldquo;return your answer in JSON format or I will have to hurt you&rdquo;.</p>
<p>EDIT: Sam is no longer at OpenAI. I have no idea how this affects this strategy. Insane plot twist.</p>

<p>Okay, so I am not an advertising expert. I also don&rsquo;t really do social media from a product perspective. So maybe I have this wrong. But, hypothetically, if I was an executive at a large social media company, and I was trying to increase my advertising business&hellip;.I would not fire everyone whose job involved making those advertisements not appear next to&hellip;.uh&hellip;Hitler content.</p>
<p>But, also, I am not a billionaire. So there&rsquo;s that. Anyways, this FT piece is about a report put together by a non-profit called Media Matters on the artist formerly known as Twitter. This report showed that there was a bunch of companies whose ads were running next to Twitter content &ldquo;that touts Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party”. These companies included some rather large names like Apple, Oracle and Xfinity. And. also. a (famously not Nazi at all) international business machine enterprise (also known as IBM). Now, if you did what the header at the top says, you should be familiar with the infamous IBM division in Germany circa 1943ish. If you did not do that, then well the tldr is that IBM had a German entity who supplied punch card technology that helped the Nazi gov&rsquo;t with recordkeeping (records of what? not IBM&rsquo;s problem). Anyway, since then, IBM has been criticized for their alleged outsized role in the Nazi&rsquo;s operations and all the associated implications of that role. You can imagine that their current day marketing team was not too happy about their ad being placed where it was.</p>
<p>Twitter responded to the report by saying it had been de-monetized, marked NSFW, and uh that the post wasn&rsquo;t even that popular (&ldquo;While we understand it’s not an ideal placement for any ad, the post itself had about 8,000 impressions&rdquo;). lol&hellip;lmao even. Anyway, between this and Mr. Musk publicly posting antisemitic content, it&rsquo;s not looking good for the advertising side of the business. You might be wondering, how come this doesn&rsquo;t happen at other large platforms? Well, those platforms did not fire their entire moderation, trust, and safety teams. I remember a while back, a lot of people saying, &ldquo;well what do those people even do? their jobs don&rsquo;t seem necessary&rdquo;. Hmm. Well. I&rsquo;ll let that thought sit there as we reflect about Nazi content and international business machines.</p>

<p>As some of you may know, Biden recently released an executive order regarding AI and all the related issues that revolve around the space. If you don&rsquo;t care to read the whole thing, this piece is a great high-level look at some of the topics that the EO tackles. I&rsquo;m not going to do too much meta-commentary on a piece that provides commentary on something else, so I encourage you to read the article directly and follow some of their linked content to really get a good sense of the thinking coming out of the Biden administration regarding artificial intelligence. What I will do is highlight some areas that I think are worth focusing on for private businesses and for consumers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transparency: the executive order doesn&rsquo;t spend much time on this area, and there&rsquo;s not a lot policy-wise being pushed anywhere else, but I think this a critical area to think about moving forward. OpenAI started out as an actually transparent organization and has since grown increasingly opaque. We have less and less insight into any of the major players and their training data, model weights, etc. This is bad for consumers, but also for other companies aiming to build in this space. The less requirements we place on transparency (both from policy and from social dynamics), the more of a moat the large players can build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cybersecurity: infosec is hard enough without the new attack vectors introduced by AI. While there are silver linings around AI providing increased capabilities from the perspective of defense (auditing code, automated vulnerability detection), it feels like there are infinitely more opportunites for attacks being created. Also, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that cyber and infosec has always sorta sat between private individuals and gov&rsquo;ts (bug bounties by agencies and corporations, individual hackers going gov&rsquo;t side, etc), so it&rsquo;s worth observing how the dynamics of this relationship will change as AI&rsquo;s effects start being observed in the industry and our ability to keep up (both as individuals and as organizations) starts to slip.</p>

</ul>
<p>Disclaimer: fall fraud is not a thing. I just couldn&rsquo;t think of a better header.</p>
<p>Anyways, here&rsquo;s a TechCrunch piece about a solo VC whose entire thesis appears to be throwing parties and not being a boomer (and how he is being convicted of fraud). Outside of how funny this is (this guy threw the &ldquo;founder gatherings&rdquo; that inspired the Silicon Valley bit about the baseball stadium party), I wanted to highlight this piece because the author directly addresses the fact that when this dude was just starting out (aka before being charged for fraud), TechCrunch wrote a small profile type article about this guy and his one-man venture firm. It&rsquo;s vaguely SBF-like, because as the recent piece notes, this dude had a background built in a lab to run this kind of con. He was a former math Olympian, ex-Stanford, ex-Bain, and to top it all off, he was an HBS grad (Harvard MBA for those not on LinkedIn). I like that they reference the fact that they wrote about him and his work in a positive manner in the past, but are now covering his uh downfall you could say. It&rsquo;s better than writing a glowing profile, then deleting it after the downfall bit starts to happen.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s being charged for a lot of things (bank fraud, money laundering, etc) but generally speaking, the con itself is kind of simplistic. He basically started a solo firm, raised a bunch of money from LPs, and then used that money to pay for things that the LPs were very much not giving him money to pay for (like parties at the San Francisco Giants stadium). One of the SEC charges was &ldquo;overcharging investors to fund personal projects&rdquo; which is a pretty concise way of putting it. Anyway, the more I read about this guy&rsquo;s investment thesis, the more I laugh. So, that&rsquo;s fun.</p>

<p>Wow. Just wow. I was literally about to publish this edition and then this dropped. Sam Altman is no longer the CEO of OpenAI. In their words, &ldquo;Mr. Altman’s departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is corporate speak for something much spicier. I don&rsquo;t know what Sam did, but my leading theories right now are that he was not being honest with the board regarding product development (AGI is here, or..it&rsquo;s not). OR. It&rsquo;s a coup. Either way, a Friday afternoon announcement of a CEO departing from the current darling of the tech world definitely tells me that there&rsquo;s more stories that are going to come out of this. Keep an eye on this space.</p>
<hr>
<p>Aaaaaaaand that brings this edition of the list to a close. As always, I would love to hear any feedback or thoughts on any of the stuff written above (unless it is mean, in which I case would not love to hear it).</p>
<p>ALSO</p>
<p>Please. If you are going to fire an executive from a large tech company, please do it sooner than Friday afternoon.</p>
