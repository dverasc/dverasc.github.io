<pre><code>&quot;The co-CEO arrangement would free Diego up to do what he loved – “getting beers with customers,” in the words of two former Wayspire employees. Veras, a self-described “builder at heart,” was at the wheel.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Well uh so I did not make the bogo edition work out last week. I am once again&hellip;late. I sort of figured this would happen (hence my constant referencing of it). There&rsquo;s no real reason as to why I have a schedule in the first place (this is my personal blog, that whoever reads can do so for free, etc), except that I uh tend to be better at things when I establish a routine and I like to commit to things. So, yes I am late again. No, it does not <em>matter</em> execept that I want to stick to a certain schedule.</p>
<p>I will keep shooting for posting once a week. Fridays will probably continue to be the day I shoot to publish on since (usually) they are a little slower than the other days of the week (except obviously the last two weeks since those Fridays were uh harder than usual).</p>
<p>Due to my continued lateness, there&rsquo;s some stuff here from a bunch of different points in time since I just kept collecting links instead of you know, writing the damn thing and publishing on time. Whatever. Please find the cool things attached below:</p>

<p>Okay so here goes my list of things I&rsquo;ve read // researched // found interesting:</p>

<h2 id="batch-vs-streaming-culture-if-you-know-what-that-means-congrats-we-are-nerds">Batch vs Streaming Culture (if you know what that means congrats we are nerds)<a href="#batch-vs-streaming-culture-if-you-know-what-that-means-congrats-we-are-nerds" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-tech-bros-and-politicians-cant-really-connect/">https://www.wired.com/story/why-tech-bros-and-politicians-cant-really-connect/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Okay so before I get into the thick of this week&rsquo;s first piece I should mention something. This was written by Paul Ford. Disclaimer: As writers (in the non literature // novelist sense) go, my personal favorites are currently Matt Levine, Kyla Scanlon, and (you guessed it) Paul mo***** Ford. So yeah I think this is a good one.</p>
<p>So what did Paul actually write about? Well, using a rather clever extended metaphor, Paul broke down the disconnect between the communities that can be described using the &ldquo;tech bro&rdquo; label and the communites that can be described using the &ldquo;utterly useless&rdquo; label.</p>
<p>(the joke here is that politicians are useless)</p>
<p>Anyway, the metaphor is clever. Paul refers to the two ways that these groups view the world as &ldquo;batch&rdquo; vs &ldquo;event loop&rdquo;. What is &ldquo;batch&rdquo; referring to here? In computing, batch or batching refers to the idea // paradigm where events happen as distinct steps or groups. Paul uses the old timey idea of computer punch cards to illustrate what batching is, &lsquo;Each batch had a discrete Before and After: You did a thing, the computer did a thing, you went back to gathering punch cards&rsquo;. But there are a bunch of other (slightly more modern) examples. One such example of batching is scheduled payroll processing. In many modern accoutning systems, you can schedule a process such as payroll processing to occur at a certain moment in time. This looks something like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Payroll is approved 7 days before payment date.</li>
<li>Payroll is then run and money withdrawn 3 days before payment date.</li>
<li>Payment hits the employee&rsquo;s bank account on payment date.</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps are the Before and After that Paul mentions. The Before is payroll being approved. The computer does the work in the middle. And the After is the money being in the employee&rsquo;s bank account. And on to the next payroll period. Batch is the perspective of the politician.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the event loop perspective is the more modern type of computing. Event loops are the more real-time (or real-time like) type of interactions that we expect in today&rsquo;s society. If you&rsquo;re techincally literate, you can think of the event loop idea that Paul poses as something like the idea of streaming processes in data. Watching a TikTok, streaming music, generative AI, and a whole host of other activities that would kill a pilgrim are all event loops. They&rsquo;re an experience, a never ending stream of events, an interactive world that would keep our monkey brains engaged until the sun goes out if it could. This is the perspective of the&hellip;.tech bro for lack of a better word.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s thesis is that these different ways of looking at the world are the fundamental differences between these groups of people and stand in the way of moving society forward (my words not his). This makes intuitive sense to me. Policy and law are inherently reactive matters. They tend to require precedent, which means clear Before and After moments by necessity. Something like seatbelt laws could only be established <em>after</em> cars were created, adopted by the masses, and used for enough time that the events like crashes that necessitate seatbelts could happen, which then caused society to come together and create policies focused on car safety and seatbelts. There was a distinct before cars (and seatbelts) were used and a distinct after cars (and seatbelts) began to be used. Tech (and commerce generally speaking) on the other hand, moves much faster. This also makes intuitive sense. Technology and commerce are not bound by precedent. In fact, a lot of the times in these worlds its best to have no precedent (innovation and all that sh*t).</p>
<p>So, what does this ultimately mean? The world is increasingly driven by event loops. And the loops are getting faster. Things feel like they are speeding up, because in some ethemeral senses, they are. The algos react faster, the experiences are more interactive, and our brains continue to move away from a batch perspective on the world. Who knows what&rsquo;s coming next.</p>

</ul>
<p>Elon Musk is the worst. He is also very annoyingly always involved in things that touch my life. So I am bound to comment on him from time to time. This is why I included this bit from Alphaville and the FT in this edition of the list. For context, Walter Isaacson, the Patron Saint of Douchebag Apologists, recently released his book on a certain south african POS (Musk not Sacks). The FT post takes a look at the more finanicially relevant parts of this book and trust me, it&rsquo;s much more entertaining than it might sound at first.</p>
<p>For example, Isaacson talks about Musk&rsquo;s internship at Scotiabank and got the department boss of that time on record discussing young Mr. Musk. This internship was in the strategic planning division of a bank. For the sake of this particular bit, you don&rsquo;t need to know much about what internships at a bank&rsquo;s strategic planning division entail outside of you basically do whatever your superiors tell you to do. They will more often than not tell you to do things that are relevant to the bank or a project, but they may not! This is what being an analyst in finance or consulting usually boils down to.</p>
<p>In the case of this particular story, Musk was tasked with &ldquo;researching Latin American debt&rdquo; (thrilling I know). During the time period that Musk was at Scotia, the conditions surrounding Latin American debt were basically: banks lent money to countries like Brazil, these countries could not pay back the loans (but they were still <em>obligated</em> to do so), and so the US treasury secretary packaged these debt obligations into securities that could be traded (the securization of everything and all that). These securities were known as &ldquo;Brady Bonds&rdquo; and were backed by the US gov&rsquo;t. This backing led to Musk thinking they should trade at 50 cents on the dollars, but out in the market they were selling at lows like 20 cents on the dollar. Musk&rsquo;s idea was basically to flip these bonds and he went as far as calling traders at Goldman to get this trade ready. After presenting the idea to his leadership however, they shot it down and said they already had too much Latin America debt and did not want to expose themselves more. Allegedly, Musk walked away from this thinking that it was crazy that banks worked this way and that it was dumb that they did that and his superior is on record saying he thinks that is what gave him &ldquo;the audacity to eventually start what became Paypal&rdquo;. I mean, sure? Like it definitely shows that Musk thought that the way the bank worked was dumb, but it doesn&rsquo;t really speak to Musk being good at finance or business or any specific audacity. The FT goes on to explain exactly why the bank did not agree with Musk&rsquo;s idea (hint: they were right to do so), but I&rsquo;m going to give you a high level breakdown of why exactly it wouldn&rsquo;t have worked:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Owning these securities meant more than just owning something like a stock. If you held this debt represented as bonds, you had to take part in the meetings, discussions, and plans on how to actually restructure this debt. You couldn&rsquo;t just trade, you had to&hellip;you know&hellip;do some work with the sovereign officials whose country&rsquo;s debt those bonds represented. Banks did not want to do that work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Musk&rsquo;s idea assumed that these bonds would always be worth 50 on the dollar. This is v likely not true, as rates would change over time and this would affect the value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The realized returns from these bonds were lower than those available from US stocks and bonds. So basically the bank would be taking on more work than they want to do, for volatile returns that weren&rsquo;t even better compared to normal instruments that the bank was using // could use (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0416.00015)">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0416.00015)</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The FT piece goes into other sections of the book (check it out, it was v interesting), but I wanted to touch on this one since I had never even heard of Musk working at a bank. Basically, my take away is the idea was not good, Musk is not actually good at finance // business, and Isaacson is a groupie.</p>

<h1 id="i-grift-you-grift-we-all-grift">I grift. You grift. We all grift.<a href="#i-grift-you-grift-we-all-grift" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tante.cc/2023/09/21/the-age-of-the-grift-shift/">https://tante.cc/2023/09/21/the-age-of-the-grift-shift/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I find myself thinking about grifters a lot these days. Between crypto (hello SBF), the recent fascination by media on startups (the Theranos show, the Uber show), and the general shift from ZIRP to whatever we call our current environment, there is plenty of stories of grifters to follow. My very own origin story and start in tech comes from my experience with a local version of these Silicon Valley grifty figures (a story for another day). I say all this to highlight just how&hellip;prevalent grifting has become. The author of this piece does a wonderful job of putting to words a lot of my feelings around this phenomena of grift.</p>
<p>The main thesis of this piece is:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Grift Shift is a new paradigm of debating technologies within a society that is based a lot less on the actual realistic use cases or properties of a certain technology but a surface level fascination with technologies but even more their narratives of future deliverance. Within the Grift Shift paradigm the topics and technologies addressed are mere material for public personalities to continuously claim expertise and “thought leadership” in every cycle of the shift regardless of what specific technologies are being talked about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honestly this excerpt is so well written and encapsualtes my sentiment so well that it could be the only thing you read from the larger piece and you&rsquo;d still walk away with a better understanding of the environment we find ourselves in (note: it shouldn&rsquo;t be, read the whole thing). The author&rsquo;s analysis of why this shift has happened at such speed and scale is worth breaking down as well. Basically, the central idea is that as a society, we have shifted all manner of creative expression to the notion of &ldquo;content&rdquo;. Content is a video, a picture, a sketch, a research paper, a blog post, etc. In the eyes of a CMS, a social platform, or a media publishing system, everything is content. And if everything is &ldquo;content&rdquo; in that typical YouTuber sense, then the priority is not the creative expression of the output, instead the priority is reach, virality, etc. Its about reaching an audience, not making things.</p>
<p>This shift and abstraction coincides with a recent focus on people taking technology and its implications at a naively high level. People talk about AI without talking about the political and economical implications. Thread boys post about the metaverse without drilling down into the source material for the term itself and how it speaks to a world fraught with the very issues we actively avoid talking about it right now. They do this because producing &ldquo;content&rdquo; at a rate that our systems rewards only incentives shallow coverage, not deep analysis. It is a perfect storm of our creativity being abstracted into &ldquo;content&rdquo; that feeds an ever churning system of consumption and people only going surface level on any complex topic or idea to produce this &ldquo;content&rdquo;. Honestly, most people aren&rsquo;t going past surface level on even non complex topics, let alone things like the labor market transformation that large language models might unlock in white collar work. This storm has created an environment that incentives the grift and the shallowness of content, from everyone in society. So, now we must fight the grift. Or be consumed by thread boys. What a future we have created.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/02/the-inside-story-of-dave-clarks-tumultuous-last-days-at-flexport.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/02/the-inside-story-of-dave-clarks-tumultuous-last-days-at-flexport.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Readers of this ongoing series may be familiar with my continued look back at Flexport and all the stories coming out of there. Its because the drama is actually spilling out into the public and I.live.for.this.shit. Corporate back dealings and pettiness is entertaining, actually, and I stand by this principle.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s new? Well, things are heating up. In September, the Flexport founder and newly reinstated CEO, Ryan Petersen, was at a supply chain conference in Phoenix (I know, its not exactly a NY fashion show or something cool like in a movie). Watching him at this conference? None other than Mr Dave Clark, who is the former CEO. In a classic sh*t talker scenario, Petersen went from trashing Clark internally and on Twitter..to complimenting Clark on his decisions and work around the purchase of Deliverr from Shopify. Trigger fingers turned to Twitter fingers as Plato once said.</p>
<p>The piece describes a lot of what this trash talking actually included, with Petersen publicly and privately critizing Dave&rsquo;s impact as having &ldquo;overspent, overhired, and overpromised&rdquo;. He allegedly burned a lot of cash and did things the board did not approve of as he geared Flexport towards an IPO. However, internal records and people on the inside have revealed that the board signed off on all the things that Dave allegedly did without their approval, and that Petersen was looped in and involved on every major decision or initiative that Clark undertook. It&rsquo;s an in-depth piece and I&rsquo;m glossing over a lot of the details comning out of that company, but generally speaking, it looks like we&rsquo;ve got a wonderful corporate drama to keep up with over the next month or so.</p>
<p>One last thing to keep in mind on this. Flexport apparantly paid Nelly $150k to perform at a recent product reveal event. Petersen decided to cancel this performance because &ldquo;the optics were bad after his post about rescinding job offers&rdquo; (lol, lmao even). Flexport ended up paying Nelly the $150k anyway. Love it.</p>

<p>Aaaaaand that&rsquo;s it folks. I did not hit my goal for bogo posts last week, and I had a difficult time getting this one out today, so I&rsquo;m going to refrain from promising anything for this Friday. Maybe I&rsquo;ll do another one, maybe I won&rsquo;t. The only thing I can sort of commit to is that I will try to post weekly. Let me know if you have any thoughts on this edition or the ongoing series!</p>
