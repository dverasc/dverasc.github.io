<p>Welcome to the second edition of my Weekly List. We made it to Week II. Let&rsquo;s see if we can get to the next. Anyway, this week&rsquo;s piece has more linked articles than the first, mostly because I had a little bit more time to scavenge the Internet than usual.</p>

</ul>
<p>This is a fun one. Some professors out of Wharton &amp; Cornell (love it) decided to test a bunch of MBA students versus ChatGPT (4 btw, none of that broke boy 3.5 turbo nonsense) in the realm of&hellip;&hellip;&ldquo;innovation&rdquo;. Innovation is defined in their uh research as novel ideas, &ldquo;represented by a pool of 200 randomly selected ideas from our Wharton students&rdquo; for team human whereas team LLM was instructed to &ldquo;generate 100 ideas&rdquo; for &ldquo;a new product or service appealing to college students that could be made available for $50 or less.” The machines were also (sampled? questioned? tested?) using few shot prompting techniques.</p>
<p>The results? Basically, machines sorta won. Academia says that there are 3 dimensions to gauge creative peformance. These being &ldquo;the quantity of ideas, the average quality of ideas, and the number of truly exceptional ideas.&rdquo; (lmao). Anyways, machines win on quantity measured against time for obvious reasons (stochastic parrot machine go brrr). Based on a market survey that was run against the ideas generated, both the vanilla and few shot GPT generated ideas were more likely to be purchased (human ideas sit at 40%, machines at 40% and 47%). Which means machines beat humans in average quality too. The final category would appear to be the most important, since innovation is typically thought of us as home runs type of game (one in a million unicorn and all that). To gauge this metric, the researchers drilled down into the top 10% of the overall ideas as a result of the market survey and when looking at the source of these ideas, 5 came from the humans and 35 came from the machines (15 for vanilla, 20 for few shot). So, uh not the best showing for humans.</p>
<p>What does this mean? Idk not much really. The authors end talking about how the future is copilots, AI assisting humans and etc. I tend to agree with this conclusion. Mostly it is just funny that the population sampled was Ivy League MBA students, who as we all know are the world&rsquo;s most innovative thinkers. Lol, lmao even.</p>

<p>Some of you may have come across a viral TikTok that went over this insane modern marvel, but if you did not, the title sorta says it all. There is (was?) literally a Pirate Stock Exchange in Somalia. Now, the exact details are murky (no one takes notes on criminal conspiracies like they used s/o Stringer Bell), but the basic gist is that uh there are not many economic levers to pull in Somalia so some enterprising folks recognized that one of the ones they could pull on was well&hellip;piracy. So, a market was created where non pirate locals could contribute money to different&hellip;pirate ships (not joking), and if // when the mission was succesful, the non pirate investors would receive an appropriate share of the gains. You can imagine some of the dynamics of this market. Sometimes the investors put in equipment or insider tips on good targets instead of actual capital. Some of the more operationally minded investors would help plot out the routes and logistics of each&hellip;..endeavor. There was also a lot of bribery, and corruption, and violence. BUT. ALSO. &ldquo;One lady invested an RPG-7 towards such a venture and apparently received a hefty US$75,000 (UA$104,000) in return.&rdquo; I mean, come on.</p>
<p>(DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT ENDORSE CRIME NOR PIRACY NOR CAPITALISM.)</p>

<p>This piece by Kate Lindsay focuses on the unique moment that social media finds itself in. People aren&rsquo;t posting like they used to. Specifically, people have stopped seeing social media as a way to connect with their actual social graph. Instead, it&rsquo;s all about broadcasting to an audience. Like a brand does. The quote from Insider that Kate uses puts it perfectly, &ldquo;As more people have been confronted with the consequences of constant sharing, social media has become less social and more media.&rdquo; I think we all know what this is referring to. It&rsquo;s the Instagramification of things. Everything is an ad or a promo or a very targeted mechanism to do something. Even shit posting is monetized! So now everyone is either on Discord or group chats or DMs to actually talk and share with their social groups. And if they have something to promote // sell, they will post. Sick. Love it.</p>
<p>Something will give I&rsquo;m sure. Being on social media these days feels like being around at the end of something. It feels like the last sigh of an era as it dies. Who knows what comes next? (it&rsquo;s not Mastodon, sorry nerds)</p>

<p>This was a really interesting look at the fracturing of corporate culture and how our cultural images and artifacts have shifted over time. Michelle sets the context really well by positing the Ad men of the US as one of those really strong cultural images, that then morphed into the&hellip;weirdly aspirational interpretation of American Psycho and Wolf of Wall Street as the more modern cultural images. From those archetypes we got things like finance bros and techbros and all those 2010s grindset memes. Like so many legacy cultural waves however, these different artifacts and representations are becoming fragmented, splintering into their own variants as media consumption becomes more and more personalized and niche. Its the death of the monoculture of corporate. And what a death. Between this fragmentation and the huge shift in how we see employment after COVID, labor (aka people) now finds itself without these cultural images and artifacts that often worked as a kind of veil over the common issues that we all struggled with. Now that this veil is splintering, we&rsquo;re left with Day in the Life tik toks as we keep fighting for higher pay, health insurance, and less assholes around us as we work.</p>

<p>More technical than the other pieces this week, I found this substack piece to be a really insightful and digestible take on the whole is AI actually thinking debate. This piece in particular is framed as: can LLms <em>reason</em>? What is reasoning? In this case, it is defined as &ldquo;a process that involves composing multiple steps of inference.&rdquo; In other words, it&rsquo;s the ability to abstract, to approach things generally, in such a way that its more than simple pattern matching.</p>
<p>Do LLMs posssess this ability? Melanie lays out some of the research done in this area and what it finds. Generally speaking, the bulk of this research is focused around chain of thought prompting, which is basically a prompting technique that gives the model some example problems + the reasoning to solve it, then asks it to use that reasoning towards a new problem that the user presents (there&rsquo;s also zero shot chain of thought, which is really just adding a phrase like &ldquo;let&rsquo;s think step by step&rdquo; to your prompt, which I love). An example of such an interaction is something like</p>
<pre><code>**Prompt**
The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 4, 8, 9, 15, 12, 2, 1.
A: Adding all the odd numbers (9, 15, 1) gives 25. The answer is False.

The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 15, 32, 5, 13, 82, 7, 1. 
A: 

**Answer**
Adding all the odd numbers (15, 5, 13, 7, 1) gives 41. The answer is False.
</code></pre>
<p>An example of zero shot prompting is something like:</p>
<pre><code> **Prompt**
I visited the bookstore and purchased 15 books. I lent 3 books to my friend and donated 4 to the local library. Later, I bought 7 more books and sold 2. How many books do I have now? Let's think step by step

**Answer**
You visited the bookstore and purchased 15 books.
Initial count: 15 books
You lent 3 books to your friend.
To find out how many books you have left, subtract the 3 books you lent from the initial count: 15 - 3 = 12 books
You donated 4 books to the local library.
Now, subtract the 4 books you donated from the current count: 12 - 4 = 8 books
You bought 7 more books.
To find out the updated count, add the 7 books you bought to the current count: 8 + 7 = 15 books
You sold 2 books.
Lastly, subtract the 2 books you sold from the updated count: 15 - 2 = 13 books
</code></pre>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where it gets funky: we don&rsquo;t actually know if this their actual thought process. The models aren&rsquo;t trained to reply their own internal mechanism to reaching a certain output, they are trained to predict the most statistically likely token to appear next given an input (within the context of said input). Which means there is no way to tell if this chain of thought output is actually what is happening under the hood. In a lot of ways, it&rsquo;s just telling us what it &ldquo;thinks&rdquo; we want to hear! What fun problem to be digging into.</p>

</ul>
<p>So last week, I ended with a tweet and some general context around the fun insider drama happening at Flexport. Specifically, I ended saying to watch this space. Well, space has been watched. Or something. I don&rsquo;t know, the point is, more info came out around what&rsquo;s going on over there and it turns out&hellip;things are not that good (lol). Their revenue dropped 70% (!) in the first half of the year as the freight market went downhill around it. This cyclicality intuitively makes sense, since supply chain woes have lessened as we came out of the unique COVID environment. This means a lot of the high margins players in this space could command are sort of not really there anymore. Flexport specifically made a lot of money by taking a cut of the costs of shipping services. With shipping rates coming back down as the supply chain loosened, that cut got smaller and smaller. Still, that&rsquo;s a huge decrease in revenue. Should be a fun time for Ryan. Let&rsquo;s see what else comes out over the next couplew weeks.</p>

<p>Aaaaand that brings the second Weekly List edition to a close. If you made it this far, thanks for reading and keep an eye out for next week&rsquo;s edition. Maybe I&rsquo;ll write it.</p>
