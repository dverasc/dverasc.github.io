        <p>This is going to be me telling you about me, in buzzwords and also in plain English.</p>
<p>My name is Diego Veras and this is a collection of my thoughts, projects, and other things.</p>
<p>During business hours (and often outside of business hours), I&rsquo;m a Managing Partner and Product Manager at <a href="https://arcvale.com/"><strong>Arcvale</strong></a> . We&rsquo;re an interactive technology studio, developing both strategy and products for clients as well as creating our own studio products (web // mobile apps, games, interactive experiences, etc). We specialize in cloud-native development, VR/AR, and 3D modeling. Basically, we make things, sometimes for ourselves, sometimes for people that pay us. I&rsquo;m generally responsible for studio operations &amp; strategy, selling and leading client engagements, and leading development teams for our in-house products. My interests and focus revolves around digital products, cloud technologies and data analytics.</p>
<p><strong>If you&rsquo;re interested in hiring us to build you things, please reach out here:</strong></p>
<p>&mdash;&gt; <em><strong>diego at (wayspire) (dot) com</strong></em></p>
<p>When it comes to projects (more buzzwords), I&rsquo;ve led multi-disciplinary teams for clients of various sizes, from international pharmaceuticals to early stage VR startups &amp; have hands-on experience as a data analyst, engineer, &amp; cloud architect (see: AWS certified associate archictect) and have experience across all the major cloud providers. I usually develop with Go, Python, Docker, and MongoDB but I&rsquo;ve worked with most of the major relational dbs and a little of js // typescript as well. As far as credentials go, I have a BS in MIS &amp; Commercial Entrepreneurship (s/o Jim Moran) and an MS in MIS, all from Florida State.</p>
<p>Outside of my email-job life, I enjoy getting punched in the face on the weekends (see: rugby) and usually care about soccer &amp; basketball as well. You can find me on Twitter (see: <a href="https://twitter.com/diegov97">@ diegov97</a>) and on <a href="https://dverasc.github.io/showcase/socials/">other places online</a> except the big blue app &amp; vine&rsquo;s dumb cousin.</p>
