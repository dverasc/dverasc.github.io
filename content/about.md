[ BUZZWORDS ]


My name is Diego Veras and this is a collection of my thoughts, projects, and other things.

During business hours (and often outside of business hours), I'm a Principal at Wayspire, a technology firm housing three different organizations: [**Arcvale**](https://arcvale.com/),[**Sitebolts**](https://sitebolts.com/), and Lenetic Labs. We do a lot, but in general, our teams are working on internal product // game development, client services, and R&D. Basically, we make things, sometimes for ourselves, sometimes for people that pay us. I oversee operations, client engagements, and in-house product development (I make things, sell things, and put out fires). My interests and focus revolve around digital products, cloud technologies, and data analytics.

When it comes to buzzwords, I've worn a bunch of different hats (product management, data analytics, and cloud native development) for companies of all sizes, from multinational corporations to early stage startups. When I do get a chance to code, I typically use Go, Python, Docker, and MongoDB, but I've also worked with little of js // typescript + rust and most of the major cloud providers and relational databases. As for education, I have a BS and MS in Information Systems and a BS in Commercial Entrepreneurship (s/o Jim Moran), all from Florida State University (go noles).

Outside of my email-job life, I enjoy getting punched in the face on the weekends (see: rugby) and usually care about soccer & basketball as well. You can find me on Twitter (see: [@ diegov97](https://twitter.com/diegov97)) and on [other places online](https://dverasc.github.io/showcase/socials/) except the big blue app & vine's dumb cousin.
