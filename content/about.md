[ BUZZWORDS ]


My name is Diego Veras and this is a collection of my thoughts, projects, and other things.

During business hours (and often outside of business hours), I'm a Managing Director at Wayspire. Wayspire is a technology firm that operates as a holding company for three different organizations, [**Arcvale**](https://arcvale.com/),[**Sitebolts**](https://sitebolts.com/), and Lenetic Labs. We do a lot, but in general, our teams are working on variety of technologies with the intent to develop products, conduct R&D, and provide boutique advisory and implementation services. Basically, we make things, sometimes for ourselves, sometimes for people that pay us. I'm generally responsible for operations, selling and leading client engagements, and leading development teams for our in-house products. My interests and focus revolves around digital products, cloud technologies and data analytics.

When it comes to projects (more buzzwords), I've led multi-disciplinary teams for clients of various sizes, from multinational corporations to early stage startups & have hands-on experience as a product manager, data analyst, & cloud architect ([see: AWS certified associate architect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-veras/details/certifications/)). I'm not tied to AWS though and have project experience across all the major cloud providers. I spend most of my time working with development teams as a pm and in client facing roles across projects, setting product strategy, handling P&L, business development etc. When I do get to touch code, I usually develop with Go, Python, Docker, and MongoDB but I've worked with most of the major relational dbs and a little of js // typescript as well. As far as credentials go, I have a BS & MS in Information Systems & BS in Commercial Entrepreneurship (s/o Jim Moran), all from Florida State University (go noles). 

Outside of my email-job life, I enjoy getting punched in the face on the weekends (see: rugby) and usually care about soccer & basketball as well. You can find me on Twitter (see: [@ diegov97](https://twitter.com/diegov97)) and on [other places online](https://dverasc.github.io/showcase/socials/) except the big blue app & vine's dumb cousin.
