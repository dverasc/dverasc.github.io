[ BUZZWORDS ]


My name is Diego Veras and this is a collection of my thoughts, projects, and other things. Contrary to popular belief, I am not a large language model. 

During business hours (and often outside of business hours), I'm a Principal at [**Wayspire**](https://wayspire.com), a diversified holding firm housing three different teams: [**Arcvale**](https://arcvale.com/), [**Sitebolts**](https://sitebolts.com/), and [**Lenetic Labs**](http://lenetic.com/). 

We do a lot, but in general, our teams are working on product // game development & technical client services. **Basically, we make things, sometimes for ourselves, sometimes for people that pay us.**

I oversee strategy & operations (aka put out fires), client engagements (aka sell things), and in-house product development (aka make things). 


**If you're interested in hiring us to build you things, please reach out here:**

Mostly, I'm a bit of wrangler, whether its data or people. I often find myself moving data from one place to another, or moving people from project to project. When I'm not doing that, I'm usually talking to devs // clients // users and writing. As far as buzz words go, this translates to product management, data analytics, and cloud native development for companies of all sizes, from multinational corporations to early stage startups. My tools of choice these days are between Python, Rust, and Go (even JS every once in a while), with some variation of SQL somewhere in there. As for education, I have a BS and MS in Information Systems and a BS in Commercial Entrepreneurship (s/o Jim Moran), all from Florida State University (go noles).

Outside of my email-job life, I enjoy getting punched in the face on the weekends (see: rugby) and usually care about soccer & basketball as well. You can find me on Twitter (see: [@ diegov97](https://twitter.com/diegov97)) and on [other places online](https://dverasc.github.io/showcase/socials/) except the big blue app & vine's dumb cousin.
