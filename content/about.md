This is going to be me telling you about me, in buzzwords and also in plain English.


My name is Diego Veras and this is a collection of my thoughts, projects, and other things.

During business hours (and often outside of business hours), I'm a Managing Partner and Product Manager at [**Arcvale**](https://arcvale.com/) . We're an interactive technology studio, developing both strategy and products for clients as well as creating our own studio products (web // mobile apps, games, interactive experiences, etc). We specialize in cloud-native development, VR/AR, and 3D modeling. Basically, we make things, sometimes for ourselves, sometimes for people that pay us. I'm generally responsible for studio operations & strategy, selling and leading client engagements, and leading development teams for our in-house products. My interests and focus revolves around digital products, cloud technologies and data analytics. 

**If you're interested in hiring us to build you things, please reach out here:**

When it comes to projects (more buzzwords), I've led multi-disciplinary teams for clients of various sizes, from international pharmaceuticals to early stage VR startups & have hands-on experience as a data analyst, engineer, & cloud architect (see: AWS certified associate archictect) and have experience across all the major cloud providers. I usually develop with Go, Python, Docker, and MongoDB but I've worked with most of the major relational dbs and a little of js // typescript as well. As far as credentials go, I have a BS in MIS & Commercial Entrepreneurship (s/o Jim Moran) and an MS in MIS, all from Florida State. 

Outside of my email-job life, I enjoy getting punched in the face on the weekends (see: rugby) and usually care about soccer & basketball as well. You can find me on Twitter (see: [@ diegov97](https://twitter.com/diegov97)) and on [other places online](https://dverasc.github.io/showcase/socials.md) except the big blue app & vine's dumb cousin.
