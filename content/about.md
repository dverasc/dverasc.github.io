[ BUZZWORDS ]


My name is Diego Veras and this is a collection of my thoughts, projects, and other things.

During business hours (and often outside of business hours), I'm putting out fires at Wayspire, a technology firm that operates as a holding company for three different organizations: [**Arcvale**](https://arcvale.com/),[**Sitebolts**](https://sitebolts.com/), and Lenetic Labs. We do a lot, but in general, our teams are working on a variety of technologies with the intent to develop products and games, conduct R&D, and provide boutique advisory and implementation services. Basically, we make things, sometimes for ourselves, sometimes for people that pay us. I oversee operations, client engagements, and in-house product development. My interests and focus revolve around digital products, cloud technologies, and data analytics.

When it comes to buzzwords, I've got a wealth of technical experience in various roles and functions (product management, data analytics, and cloud native development) for companies of all sizes, from multinational corporations to early stage startups. When I do get a chance to code, I typically use Go, Python, Docker, and MongoDB, but I've also worked with little of js // typescript + rust and most of the major cloud providers and relational databases. As for education, I have a BS and MS in Information Systems and a BS in Commercial Entrepreneurship (s/o Jim Moran), all from Florida State University (go noles).

Outside of my email-job life, I enjoy getting punched in the face on the weekends (see: rugby) and usually care about soccer & basketball as well. You can find me on Twitter (see: [@ diegov97](https://twitter.com/diegov97)) and on [other places online](https://dverasc.github.io/showcase/socials/) except the big blue app & vine's dumb cousin.
