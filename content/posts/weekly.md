## **WHAT IS THIS**

    "The world, unfortunately, is real; I, unfortunately, am Diego."

Okay so I have not written in a while. Lot of things are happening, but I'm trying to get better at the discipline that is writing. Due to that, I have created a new thing for myself that I'm calling my "Weekly List." Basically, I am going to try to start curating and tracking the many pieces of long form content that I consume and write about what I think of them.

Some of my thinking behind this is:

A) I have trouble finding the time // focus // (insert excuse here) to do long form pieces in a traditional format. I'm hoping this might help me write more.

B) I send people links of things I've read that I like and they end up lost in the ether of continuous digital chat. This will help track it.

C) Relatedly, said people have told me I read more long form content than most. Assuming this is true, maybe I can leverage that and help curate content for others. Maybe. I don't know.


## **ANYWAYS HERE'S THE STUFF** ##

Okay so here goes my list of things I've read // researched // found interesting:

## A deep dive into telecom & networking companies with an eye towards AI ##

- https://www.inevitabilityresearch.com/p/the-future-of-networking-and-telecom

Probably my longest read of the week and one of the most comprehensive pieces I dove into recently. Sophie put together a v. in-depth report breaking down the network & telecommunications sector and its various subsectors (aka companies that make money from moving bits of data around). They managed to bring together all the different levels of abstraction, tooling, and components of these very distinct specialties and subsectors and synthesize all that into an analysis that very clearly ties together into the current AI boom cycle and paints a clear picture towards the long term trends we're seeing develop in front of us. The sections on edge computing and data centers were particularly interesting to me, and I love how they provided relevant players for each sub-sector that they broke down. A great piece from a great author and poster. Go check it out.

## A look into Rotten Tomatoes that leaves you feeling...rotten (booooooo) 

- https://www.vulture.com/article/rotten-tomatoes-movie-rating.html

Okay so this one is really interesting to because I am the king of not watching things without checking the Rotten Tomatoes rating. It's uh not exactly surprising that this system has been gamed (what part of the godforsaken internet hasn't been?), but it is really sad that the state of the film // tv industry relies on Rotten f***** Tomatoes (also sort of funny in a cynical way?). Anyway, here's the basic gist:

    1.  Rotten Tomatoes started out as one of those seemingly innocent webpages that sprung up in the Web 1.0 years 
    
    2.  As time passed and the dot com bust came and went, RT continue to be bought and sold in a decades long series of M&A transactions and "synergies" being discovered
    
    3.  Its final destination was Fandango, who acquired it in 2016ish I believe
    
    4.  By this point, Rotten Tomatoes became THE signal for quality in film and tv. Its reviews make or break releases. This made it a prime target for every suit in the world to try to juice their ratings and hit those sweet, sweet KPI-tied bonuses and whatnot.
    
    5.  Becoming the de-facto sign of quality in Hollywood has uhhh not been good for anyone really? The formula that RT uses for its rankings is so simple that I laughed out loud when I read it ("Scores are calculated by classifying each review as either positive or negative and then dividing the number of positives by the total") and the team behind it has never been able to really identify the best way to incenvtize user behavior towards a platform that actually provides value to its users.
    
    6.  As the article shows, all this had led to a v. easily manipulated system that PR firms, media execs, and other non creative stakeholders are constantly trying to game in order to shape public perception and reception of films and tv shows. There is no source of truth anymore. 
    
    7.  Suffice to say, this has led to v. weird situations (i.e Ant-Man Quantum Mania released to a 79 rating and a massive opening weekend, then fell to the 40s, after which it had the worst drop off in Marvel history in the following weekend) recently and makes me want to never trust a review again.


I don't really know what else to say except that this sucks? And I'm not sure anyone really benefits except for PR reps and rando studio VPs, so it sucks even more. At this point, it feels like every piece of digital real estate is some disappointing vehicle for manipulation focused on driving money to the people contributing the least, which just leaves you feeling slightly gross. So that's super fun.

### A soulful post breaking down loneliness and the fragmentation of our despair

- https://kyla.substack.com/p/fragmentation-polarization-and-the    

Kyla is one of the best writers // thinkers in econ today and this piece is a testament to that. I haven't found anyone that captures the real humanity behind econ & finance like she does and this particular post hit me pretty strongly. 
She (very accurately) describes the feelings of nihilism and almost social homelessness of the modern age, the breaking of the social contract that we are all reeling from, and manages to tie together a lot of different topics into a main thesis that is particularly poignant for people our age, 
> *"Because there is a void of community, because we are trying to calibrate to suffering, because we are waiting for a marshmallow, but waiting is the actual dystopia. We have misplaced outrage that we turn into consumption of videos about Fake Karens. We get behind people selling a newsletter subscription about how the world is going to end."*

We live in a society that is constantly bombarded with information, and data, and news, and we are told that the world used to be a certain way and that there were these rules that had to be followed and then we look up and away from our screens and realize nothing that we were told is true. We live in the constant storm of content and outrage and numbness and the vague notion that things aren't how they ought to be. She doesn't exactly point to a silver bullet solution (because there is none), but as always, she ends her piece with words // thoughts that follow me long after I finished reading (this time courtesy of Borges), 
> *"Time is the substance I am made of. Time is a river which sweeps me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger which destroys me, but I am the tiger; it is a fire which consumes me, but I am the fire. The world, unfortunately, is real; I, unfortunately, am Borges."*

### Dave is no longer being allowed to cook at Flexport

- https://twitter.com/typesfast/status/1700092765798048093?s=20

This one is not long-form content, instead its a tweet from the founder and newly returned CEO of Flexport announcing that one of his first moves is to....rescind job offers? Sort of a weird move given his recent tweets were focused on the large "war chest" his company has + a private jet his company owns (lol), but I think aside from being a needlessly cruel corproate action, it also speaks to some weird stuff going on around that particular company. To provide some brief context, last year, the outgoing CEO, Dave Clark, came in from Amazon to take the reigns from the founder (and now once again CEO), Ryan Petersen. Ryan went on to become the Executive Chairman, a partner at Founders Fund, and one of the last few posters on the hellsite formerly known as Twitter. Then at some point in the last couple weeks, some beef happened (?) and Dave was fired by the board (presented as a resignation), and Ryan came back in. The interesting bits is how all this went down. Dave's outgoing memo basically said "I had a plan, these people have a dumber plan that I don't agree with, so I am out" and then days later, Ryan started tweeting about rescinding job offers, subleasing office spaces, and pretty much throwing Dave under the bus. There's not too many details out just yet (hence why I'm posting a tweet and not a longer form piece), but I am v. curious to see what comes out of this. Keep an eye on this space.

And that concludes the first installment of my Weekly List. Let's hope there's another one next week.
