## **WHAT IS THIS**

    "I offer no explanation as to why my code seems to work; I attribute that API's success, as all else, to divine benevolence."


Today is a little different. Quite a short list (only two items). While the list is short, I think you'll find it quite dense, since the items themselves are pretty hefty. Anyway, this edition was inspired by: 

a) the resurgence in manifestos being posted lately. 

b) a tweet I saw somewhat recently (that I suspect is now deleted since I could not find it again). To paraphrase said tweet, it basically was along the lines of "young people should post less analysis and more takes". 

So, while this piece is purposefully *not* a manifesto (I uh don't want to end up on any watch lists), it is sort of a reply to them, with a bunch of takes.



## **ANYWAYS HERE'S THE STUFF** ##

Okay so here goes my list of things I've read // researched // found interesting:

## And for my next trick, I will improve this transformer models output quality with no explanation as to why it works  ##

- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05202.pdf

As is often the case recently, this is an AI bit. Specifically, this is a research paper on a type of architecture for natural language processing called "Gated Linear Units". Also known as GLUs, they are defined in the abstract as "the component-wise product of two linear projections, one of which is first passed through a sigmoid function". 

In uh slightly more plain english, GLUs are basically mathematical formulas that (in the context of machine learning) are used as an activation function for ML models. These models (aka neural networks) are built in layers, and an activation function is sorta the gatekeeper that alters an output signal (basically a series of values) from its current state to the next. It essentially filters the data that is passed to each layer, helping determine what is relevant information for the network to "learn". They help create faster and more accurate models since they help these models capture long-term dependencies in sequences (important for understanding relationships, context, etc) + they help mitigate the vanishing gradient issue found in deep learning models, buzz word, buzz word, buzz word, and so on. 

This paper was basically a study in the effect of replacing the standard activation functions that transformers (aka the cool new models that are used in ChatGPT and all the variants) use with GLUs and their unique architecture. The results? Well, they were positive! Using GLUs and tweaking different aspects of the model sublayers provided quality improvements compared to their more commonly used activations. This is a good finding by any measure I think. 

HOWEVER. All of that is beside the point! Because this post is about the final line in the paper. As the authors write, "We offer no explanation as to why these architectures seem to work; we attribute their success, as all else, to divine benevolence.". God, I love that. Like it or not, that is a *bar*. The cynical part of me is a bit uh concerned about the idea of lacking enough deep insight into technical advances that we regress to some sort of myth making state ("any sufficiently advanced tech is indistinguishable from magic" and all that). BUT. At the same time....technology can really be awesome. I mean that in the biblical sense. Not like, "wow that burger was awesome". More like, awesome as in awe inspiring. As in, the feeling you get when a burning bush speaks to you. Or something like that. Generally speaking, I try not to place judgement on the good or bad of technology, as its often a tool defined in the hand of its user (disclaimer: the key word here is often, not always). But I often find myself in awe of it. The things we make. As wonderful as they are awful. In so many ways, awe inspiring. And amongst all of that, there is something of a divine benevolence. So, I tip my hat to the researchers. Truly, sometimes no explanation can be offered.


Also, next time someone asks me why my fix for a bug works, I will be sure to cite divine benevolence.

## e/acc more like lam/eacc amiright ##


- https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html


I mentioned manifestos at the top. It's certainly been a time for those. The ghost of browser past himself posted a quite....insane one quite recently (that is Marc Andreessen, and his writings of techno optimism and "cool" Twitter accounts to follow). In a recent addition to this genre, Vitalik Buterin posted his take and interpretation of "techno optimism". As quick reminder, Vitalik is a software developer, the co-founder of Ethereum, and generally speaking, one of the less grifty people in the crypto space. I mean that in the best way possible. I think Vitalik is one of the rare cases of founder brain that doesn't lead to some variation of the classic absolute power absolutely corrupts trope that is all too common. 

With that in mind, his post has a lot of the intellectual considerations that you tend to find in the crypto community. Ideas such as centralized vs decentralized governance, cryptography, and more, through the framework of "defensive technology" and examples of the bits and atoms that make these up. But he also covers a wide array of non crypto technologies, including AI, vaccines, etc. And while he covers this and more in-depth, this being a philosphical type of post, I'd like to speak on those aspects more than anything else. 

Vitalik's thesis as I interpret it, is found in a couple different statements:

- "I love technology because technology expands human potential."

- "I believe that these things are deeply good, and that expanding humanity's reach even further to the planets and stars is deeply good, because I believe humanity is deeply good"

- "And so it is my firm belief that, out of all the things that we have known and seen in our universe, we, humans, are the brightest star"


My own non-manifesto shares directionally similar thoughts. Truly, I believe humanity is deeply good. And so, expanding our potential is also deeply good. But there are nuances to this. And limits that go along with that nuance. Vitalik shares some of these nuances, and while he offers a lot of absolutes that some may consider less concrete than how he frames them to be, he at least acknowledges the challenges in front of any future "growth","development", or "building". The prophet of a16z instead seems to focus more on disparaging anything that gets in the way of what he has determined to be the absolute direction of our future. He does not consider challenges or nuance, instead he paints anyone that is not part of his cult as an enemy of humanity. Including *checks notes* risk management and sustainability (LMAO). So uhh yeah I think Vitalik's writing is a little bit more sensible. 

Anyway, I suggest people check out Vitalik's piece in full. He (unlike some others mentioned in this very post) is still actively working on the things he opines on, and has a perspective on what's around the corner that I consider grounded in any sort of concrete analysis. As for the king of VC twitter's post? I uh don't really recommend it, since in all honesty his writing is not exactly...good? And the ideas are basically a rehashing of tech twitter's latest fads. It literally reads like a long-ass twitter thread that a bunch of stable diffusion pfp bots quote tweet. In fact, it's bad enough that I cannot believe the firm's comms people let him post it at all. All that noise and no actual substance. 

But he's rich! So that's cool.

So that is December's first list. Not too many items, but a lot of fun concepts like divine benevolence and neural network system architectures.
