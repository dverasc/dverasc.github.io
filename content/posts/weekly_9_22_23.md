## **WHAT IS THIS**

    "The cloud computing credits keep moving. In a circle"

![image alt text](/iasip-its-always-sunny.png)

Welcome to the third edition of my Weekly List. We made it to Week III. And also IV. Because this is late. It was bound to happen eventually...and it did. Technically, this was meant to be published on Friday the 23rd. Today is suspiciously Monday the 25th. What are you gonna do. Things break. People get upset. Fires have to be put out. All that good stuff. Anyways that means this week is a bogo edition, since this Friday we are back to my ambigiously regular programming. Maybe. See above about two sentences back about fires.

## **ANYWAYS HERE'S THE STUFF** ##

Okay so here goes my list of things I've read // researched // found interesting:

## Arm IPOS. Deloitte wins. Boooo(?) ##

- https://www.ft.com/content/71c08901-3bf1-4435-ae3f-ff608736be33

If you haven't heard....IPO szn is upon us. The public markets have been quiet on the M&A // IPO front recently (hmmm wonder why), so Arm going public is a big deal. I'm not gonna get into the details of the initial public offering itself (nor too much into their movement since they were listed). Instead, I thought this piece going into the different service providers & advisors that played a role in this IPO was very interesting since it gives us a peek behind the curtain at the various players. And boy were there were many players. 

*Okay so some real quick definitions before we get into the details outlined in the article. Buzzword time!*


    * Underwriting: underwriting happens in all types of transactions, but generally refers to the process of someone (typically a bank or some specialized financial services provider) asssessing the risk and valuation of a business or asset. This requires a lot of research, financial analysis, and modeling. Underwriting is seen in the context of loans and insurance as well, but in this case, we are talking about finding the value and risks within the company aiming to be publicly listed.
    * IPO: aka Initial Public Offering. This is the process that a private company undergoes in order to become a publicly traded company. This process allows a formerly private company (whose shares can only be owned by a small group of accredited investors, founders, VCs, etc) to offer their shares to the general public (aka you and me). Typically this involves a lot of due diligence, underwriting, and generally complying with the SEC and their terms. Companies go public to get additional capital and funding from a wider range of people. Some fun variations of this include SPACS, direct listings, etc. 
    * M&A: mergers & acquistions. Basically any type of transaction where a company buys another or sells itself (or parts of itself). While an IPO isn't a merger nor an acquisition, these types of deals tend to go hot and cold at the same time since they reflect sentiment (aka vibes) in the public markets. If things are chilly in M&A, it's not very likely that IPOs are still popping.


Okay so now we got some fun buzzwords out of the way, here's an idea of the scale of the process of going public. According to the piece, this initial public offering "was the most expensive in fees for five years, earning a $84mn windfall for the professional services firms that advised it, including Deloitte."* 

What does all that money go to?

Well, mostly to accounting. In an IPO that was "seven times more than the average large listing, making it the third most costly in the past decade", the main beneficaires were Deloitte (who audited the accounting) and Morrison & Foerster, who was the main legal adviser in this fun little group project. What does all this money actually get you? Well according to Deloitte, a lot of the (expensive) work came in converting Arm's financial statements to US accounting standards (as opposed to the international standards they were operating with before). Also apparantly Arm's customer contracts are super complex so that also added work to the typical audit. These deals were complex enough to warrant "around $51mn" going directly to Deloitte. 

Usually, people pay the most attention to the banks that are helping a startup go public. These banks end up making money directly based on the amount of money raised in the offering. This is to align incentives, i.e. if the IPO goes well, then the bank makes a lot of guap. On the other hand, if it uhhh does not go well (see Pets.com), then the bank will not be making too much money. 

This is different! In this case, we're looking at service providers that get paid on whatever fee gets settled, actual results be damned. In Deloitte and the lawyers case, they got paid based on the work that needed to be done to get to the IPO, with the actual success mattering less than the agreed work between them being executed. In simple terms, the banks make money from a results perspective (we hired you to increase the value, so if you don't increase said value then you make less money) whereas the service providers make money from an execution perspective (we hired you to do task A, B, and C, so do A, B, and C and we will pay you, regardless of what the value ends up being). 

Anyway, Arm jumped to $63.59 per share on the 14th of this month after its IPO price of $51. It ended today trading at $54.44. Make of that what you will.

*DISCLAIMER: I worked at Deloitte many moons ago. I did not work in the service line that works on M&A things so uhhh not super relevant, but still now you know I worked there.*

##  MGM does not negotiate with terrorists


- https://www.404media.co/inside-mgms-hacked-casinos/

This is a really fun piece that really could only happen in the bizzaro modern times we live in. In case you didn't know, the digital world is one giant, gaping security vulnerability. Basically, while some individual actors may have decent cybersecurity, generally speaking we all suck at securing our systems. This is why every other day there is some new story about a company being hacked or a data breach exposing sensitive information. At this point, its fair to assume that your sh*t is floating around in the ether, since no one can secure anything. 

With that said, security incidents tend to follow a certain pattern. A hostile actor(s) manages to breach a company's systems. Usually this company is some sort of organization that holds valuable data (usually of the financial kind). The actors breach, get access to the data, and generally fuck about a company's digital assets. As they fuck around, they'll issue some sort of ultimatum. "Send XX bitcoin to XXX wallet or you'll never see the data // get access to your systems again // etc etc". It's sort of like a kidnapping dynamic. Depending on the context and data, a breached company may choose to pay the ransom (I have advised clients to not do this in the past). In this particular series of breaches, some casinos chose to comply and pay the money to get their systems up and runining. 

NOT MGM! They said we do not negotiate with terrorists. We run our casinos even if our machines don't work. This is sick. The author of this piece physically went to the casino to see what it was like. 

Some highlights:

    - "At the food courts of eight restaurants I went to, all ordering kiosks were broken. All of the kitchen management computer screens I saw behind the counters were on, but none of them were working. “Unable to connect to kitchen display service. Attempting to reconnect,” they said. A single establishment had a credit card processing machine and cash register. Two workers at that one restaurant were taking orders for all eight restaurants. After a customer ordered, another worker would grab a receipt and physically walk it to whatever restaurant the order was from. I watched the same worker walk back and forth over and over again, grabbing slips of paper from a cashier and walking them down the hall to give them to whatever kitchen needed them."
    - "Workers told me that they have to write every single transaction on these pieces of paper."
    - "The functioning ones are operating in some sort of offline mode. Normally, you can put money on a card, put that card into the slow machine, then cash out onto that card whenever you want. The players cards are not working at all, meaning that you put cash directly into the slot machines, and, when you want to cash out, you tap “cash out” and then you wait an indefinite amount of time for a casino employee to hand you cash at the machine itself.
    - "local media outlets were reporting that Larry Flynt’s Hustler Club was offering a deal for “those affected by this devastating event” in the form of free lap dances. Showing proof of a MGM hotel reservation at the club would allegedly get you a slew of other perks, including free airport pickup, luggage storage, and a free platinum VIP membership."
    - "To compare, I briefly walked into the Cosmopolitan, casino that was bought by MGM last year but will not have all of its infrastructure transferred over to MGM’s systems until next year. Every single slot machine, ATM, and everything else was working. I did not see a single out-of-order machine while wandering past hundreds of them. The only thing that was broken was a kiosk for the BetMGM sportsbook"



Let's think about the what the above implies. Workers that previously could rely on the digital systems we've all grown accustomed to (kiosks, card processers, etc) were thrown back to what I imagine the 1920s were like. People were cashing out by going up to employees and being like "hey I won a dollar, gimme money". Strip clubs were coming together to support their community. What a scene! 

Anyway, mostly I feel bad for the people working there. I'm also fascinated by the people who heard about the hack and still went to gamble. MGM must have some serious brand loyalty.. there were casinos that were working fine after the ransom was paid, but people still went to one whose equipment was in conditions like "An automated roulette machine said “No BC Comms.” Lots of machines were simply turned off entirely. A video Blackjack game said: 'Terminal bloqueado.'" Also a fun shoutout to whoever was involved in the IT integration after MGM & Cosmopolitan merged. By not finishing their work, they actually made sure that at least part of the casino's portfolio was mostly unaffected. Distributed systems baby.

###  VCs are no longer in the arena

- https://www.implications.com/p/the-great-sobriety-for-venture-investing

I found this particular piece to be really poignant given the current state of private markets and the uhhh negative sentiment that people are currently operating in. Belsky highlights a lot of the signs that led to current down market, including the intoxicating allure of the bubble that led to behavior like people "starting a company and a fund at the same time". He also breaks down the mechanisms of this bubble including lowered rates, misleading short term patterns & models, and things like "party rounds". Basically, he drills down into the different pieces that created an environment that allowed investors to live in a "spray and pray world" (my words not his). He then does a great job at highlighting lessons that investors, founders, and operators can take away. 

I found his first lesson, "Financing is a tactic, not a goal", to be the most powerful. For most of my life and definitely during my time as a professional (I am 25), raising money has been the goal for founders (notice I didn't say what the money is being raised for). People judged quality based on the vanity metrics of their latest funding round or the brand name of their investors. Never mind that they had never turned a profit or found product market fit. "Oh no you don't get it, they just raised a round led by a16z so they must be legit". See Adam Neumann's latest company (backed by a16z) and tell me that it has long term potential as an actual business enterprise (hint: it does not). 

Anyway, this whole environment never made sense to me. It's not natural. Needing outside money isn't something to brag about! It can be tactically useful to raise capital sure, but it shouldn't be the actual strategic objective (in case we forgot, that objective should be something along the lines of make more money than you lose). I think its good that we are sobering up. Build businesses, not vehicles for financing.

### The money keeps moving. In a circle

- https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-aws-anthropic-ai 

Another week, another hyperscaler "invests" in a startup. I have a couple thoughts regarding these (fairly frequent) deals.

A) It reeks of executives being scared of anti-trust and finding ways to get around the threat of regulation. "It's not an acquisition, its a strategic partnership" - some corp dev manager to a fed, probably.


B) It is also hilariously a bit of circular self-dealing. I'm attaching a fun little graphic I made to reflect this point, but I'll elaborate a bit more here: 


    - So let's say I am an AI startup. We will call this startup "Shanthropic". Let's say, as Shanthropic, I want to train my own foundational model(s). This requires cloud computing. Cloud computing at this scale is expensive and I'm just a little, scrappy startup so I need money to buy servers (or rent or whatever provisioning model you end up using). Where do I get this money? Well from outside investors of course. Now, here comes a potential investor. They have capital! They say "hey take our money". So I take it. But then, they also say "we have servers, you should use them (for a price of course)". So I use them. And how do I pay for them? Well with the money I was just given. My wire transfer says "SchAmazon". My invoices for cloud stuff says "SchAmazon". All is right with the world. 



This reminds me of that "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" episode, "The Great Recession". Dennis and Mac decide to create their own currency at the bar, sorta like a Dave n Busters vibe. This (as always) does not go well. Plot details aside, they famously describe their little economy with the idea that "The money keeps moving. In a circle". It does indeed.


Anyway here's my meme.
