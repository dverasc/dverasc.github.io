## **WHAT IS THIS**

    "The co-CEO arrangement would free Diego up to do what he loved – “getting beers with customers,” in the words of two former Wayspire employees. Veras, a self-described “builder at heart,” was at the wheel."

Couples notes off the top:

- this is a very short list
- this is also a bit late based on the whole posting weekly plan
- but it's bogo (!)

You'll see what I mean.

## **ANYWAYS HERE'S THE STUFF** ##

Okay so here goes my list of things I've read // researched // found interesting:

## uh so is this AGI in the room with us now  ##

- https://www.noemamag.com/artificial-general-intelligence-is-already-here/

Starting with a bit of a deeper one this time around. Written by two heavy hitters in the AI space (Blaise Agüera y Arcas and Peter Norvig), this piece's main thesis is that artificial general intelligence (aka AGI) is *already here*. This might be uh news to some of us, but the basic idea here is that while we're spending a lot of time bickering about paperclips and acceleration and all that fun stuff...the thing already happened. AGI is here. And we must grapple with the implications of that.

Okay, so fun buzzwords aside, what do the authors actually mean? The piece starts by trying to position their idea that the current flagship "frontier" models (basically GPT4, Bard, Llama, and Claude) are advanced enough to be classified as posesing general intelligence, given that they "perform competently even on novel tasks they were not trained for, crossing a threshold that previous generations of AI and supervised deep learning systems never managed". The authors go on to define general intelligence, which is where things always get tricky. See, the reason this piece is so interesting is that a lot of the noise we see on social media regarding AI is focused on things in the future (however near or far it may be), because for most people, while the current models are very powerful and innovative, they are not the final state. A huge chunk of the different AI ideological camps believe that AGI is not here and base a lot of their stances off that foundation. This discrepancy happens because there is still no universal definition of what artifical general intelligence is, or how it acts, or how to objectively measure and evaluate it. Not so here. Blaise and Peter's stance is that general intelligence is already here, because the top of the line models can "can perform a wide variety of tasks without being explicitly trained on each one", unlike the narrow intelligence of previous generations of models that could only do the singular task they were trained to perform. Specifically, the models can be considered generally intelligent because of their capablity across:

    - different topics (basically anything that has been writte on the internet up until the end of their training data)
    - a variety of tasks i.e chatbots, agents, media synthesis, media development, etc
    - diverse modalities, in the sense that they can work with text, images, video, and robotic sensors
    - different languages (bit questionable here, the models overindex on english due to dominance of english on the internet, but they drop off severely as far as other languges go i.e. the less represented the language is on the internet, the lower the capacity of the model to work with it.) 
    - instructablity: one shot and few shot prompting have shown that the models can perform quite well in different areas and tasks based on additional context being provided as part of the prompt input (i.e examples of the task or operation the user wants the model to perform)

The authors also recognize and acknowledge the fact that there are many people who don't agree AGI is already here. They state that this view point stems from a lack of trust in AI metrics, an "ideological commitment" to AI theories // techniques not based on LLMs, being too pro human (or biological), and // or a concern about the economic effects of artifical general intelligence. They go on to describe these different stances with more depth and a variety of sources from each camp. They do a good job of breaking these down, while still pushing their view point forward as they conclude each point. I'll give you the spark notes here:

    - lack of trust in AI metrics is basically the fact that no one can agree on a good set of metrics to measure model performance from the perspective of artifical intelligence. Even metrics that we agree on for human intelligence cannot be transfered over cleanly (i.e. models taking and passing law exams), since these models' "training is often narrowly tuned to the exact types of questions on the test". We also should not falsely assume that intelligence is measured by linguistic fluency (fluent, grammatical responses != intelligence)
    - the ideological commitment bit is basically the fact that there are many different fields and disciplines that take stances on intelligence and they have competing theories that go against the current LLM based paradigm of AGI. Linguists, computer scientists, philosophers, and so on all have different theories about intelligence and uh they sorta step on each others toes and throw shade to the others. 
    - being too pro-human or pro-biological intelligence (or as the authors put it, "Human (Or Biological) Exceptionalism") is the innate human bias towards our own sentience and consciousness. I think I fall into this camp occasionally, basically the belief that true general intelligence is inseparable from consciousness, and since these models cannot be said to be sentient in that sense, then they are not truly general intelligent. The authors argue that we should consider separating these concepts and looking past this bias. This train of thought reminds me of the book, Blindsight, by Peter Watts.
    - finally, the concern for the economic implications of AGI touches on the political economy of AI and the contrast in automation of manual vs knowledge work. In a fun twist to the usual scenario, LLMs look to have more potential at the automation of knowledge work as opposed to the manual labor that we typically associate with automation.

The final point leads to the author's conclusion, which is basically that we have let the genie out the bottle and while we argue about whether the genie is out or not, it's affecting everything around us. So uhh that is super fun.

I thought this was a thought-provoking piece. While I can't say I agree with the authors on everything, it did make me stop and consider several arguments they put forward and kept me on my current LLM deep dive. Highly recommend.

## TALKING MY OWN BOOK BABY  ##

DISCLAIMER: The second and last item in the list is one of my (non-list) posts. I've been working on a couple different proof of concepts with LLMs and semantic search and after tinkering for a couple weeks, decided to write up one of those small projects into a short case study.
