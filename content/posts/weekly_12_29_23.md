## **WHAT IS THIS**

    "but you had a point about language. When you get right down to it, it’s a work-around. Like trying to describe dreams with smoke signals. It’s noble, it’s maybe the most noble thing a body can do but you can’t turn a sunset into a string of grunts without losing something."


Let's kick this off with a programming note:

This is the final edition of the list that I will be publishing. As any reader has probably noticed from my previous schedule, while I've attempted a sort of bi-weekly posting cadence (that eventually formed into bi-monthly), it has been tough to try to maintain even that and I don't anticipate that getting any easier in 2024. So with that in mind, I will be sunsetting the list. This doesn't mean this blog itself will be shutting down or anything like that, it just means this particular bit is being shelved for now.


As such, this is also a special edition of the list. This list will be one on the longest of reads. Aka. Books. More specifically, the best books I read in 2023. It's sort of my top books of the year since its a list of the one that I've chosen to write up and post about, but not in any particular order.



## **ANYWAYS HERE'S THE STUFF** ##

Okay so (for one last time), here goes my list of things I've read // researched // found interesting:

## Non Fiction  ##

- Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel

Discovering Morgan's work has to be one of the highlights of 2023. While he recently released a new book (Same As Ever), I read his first earlier this year and walked away with a totally different way of looking at the world, specifically from a personal finance lens. I am inherently skeptical about most of the personal finance content out in the wild but Morgan combines elegant story telling with some wise and pragmatic observations on human nature and how it relates to our decision making around money. It's an easy read for a subject that often confuses readers more than it helps, I can't recommend it enough. I plan on reading his new book sometime in 2024, so if this bit ever comes back, you might find it on that list as well.

- This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends: The Cyberweapons Arms Race by Nicole Perlroth

Readers of previous editions of the list may have picked up on the fact that infosec in the real world is mostly not real and boy does this book not dissuade me of that stance. While this story reads in a fast paced manner similar to a thriller, the real kicker is it's incredibly not fictional at all. The costant dread that comes with the knowledge that none of what is written is fictional and is in fact, our current reality, is part of the fun. Infosec is one of those subjects that people tend to lump into "too complex and technical for me, can't be bothered", but the truth is that while there is plenty of script writing and command line interfacing, a lot of what goes in this field comes down to relationships, market dynamics, and the conflict between private citizens, the state, and corporations. This book does a great job of explaining this nuance while keeping readers of all technical levels engaged and turning the page. Technical or not, we need more people aware of what is really happening in this space.


- Dark Pools by Scott Patterson

2023 was the year that I dove really deep into finance, specifically, the pipelines and internal systems that make up the financial system. During my deep dive, I became (rather morbidly) fascinated with high frequency trading and the "plumbing" that make it possible. Dark Pools was the single best source of info for learning about these mechanics. On top of that, I found it particularly hard to put down because Patterson framed it as a rather compelling narrative that explored the real life people that brought these systems to life, and their ideologies, motivations, and journeys. I will note that an inevitable side effect of reading this book is a dramatically increased sense of cynicism around the financial system. But again, that's part of the fun!



- When McKinsey Comes to Town: The Hidden Influence of the World's Most Powerful Consulting Firm  by Walt Bogdanich + Michael Forsythe

Another one that will drive your cynicism up x100, I think Bogdanich and Forsythe's incredibly well researched look into McKinsey has got to be the most detailed published piece of work on the (so called) most prestigious consulting company in the world. Driven by their investigative work for the New York Times, this book really opened by eyes to how these firms work at the highest level (while I technically worked as consultnat for Del*itte, I was an analyst on the lowest rung) and how they influence society at large (not just the boardrooms of F500 companies). This book pierced the veil of several projects and their uh less than desirable societal costs with highlights including corruption in South Africa, becoming the right hand business people for the Saudis, and their all time classic, the rapid and exponential expansion of opiod distribution and subsequent crisis in the US. It's a great book, but damn if I didn't put it down with a darker view of humanity. That uh appears to be a trend with my taste in books this year.



- Venture Deals: Be Smarter Than Your Lawyer and Venture Capitalist by Brad Feld + Jason Mendelson

The final book in the non fiction category is Feld and Mendelson's extremely detailed guide for the asset class that is venture capital. This book has some narrative components, but it really is the textbook anyone would want to learn how to approach both the theoretical concept of vc, and its realities. It covers everything from the organizational structures of investment firms to deal mechanics, and everything in between. If you want an end to end, comprehensive, insider baseball type of look into VC, this is it. 



## Fiction  ##


- Blindsight by Peter Watts

I've found myself thinking about Watts book often throughout this past year with the whole AI hitting mainstream thing. Driven by some of the strongest (and strangest) world-building I've come ever across, this story covers things like the nature of consciousness, the future of humanity, and our encounters with alien intelligence. Some classic sci-fi topics. But its a really great take on them, with a specific focus on a "hard" sci fi approach, which basically means that the author worked hard to stay true to scientific accuracy. Set in the near future, where humans have continued some of our current metatrends and become a space-faring society complete with human augmentation, wide-spread artificial general(ish) intelligence, and uh vampires (that last one is somehow believable in context, trust me), the story covers first contact with an alien species that actually feels....alien. I mean this in the most literal sense. Like in a lot of other works (both good and bad), aliens are humanized to some extent or at least shown to be relatively similar to humans, or other organisms on Earth. Not so here. The aliens that we encounter are depicted as incredibly intelligent, but also not being conscious (sound familiar?). It's tough to even elaborate further on this dichotomy because well, defining consciousness is hard. But basically the aliens are not self-aware. Comparisons are made to white blood cells, etc. The "Chinese Room" thought experiment is frequently invoked. It's generally very trippy. But thought provoking! So, go read it instead of following e/acc accounts on Twitter.


- Sea of Tranquility by Emily St. John Mandely

My final book of the year, Mandely's Sea of Tranquality reminded me of some of my favorite books growing up when I put it down. Thought provoking and yet somehow light, its a really interesting story that covers metaphysics, public health & pandemics, art, and the most human of things...love. Once I picked it up, I couldn't stop and finished it in one afternoon. It has echoes of the action and time travel ideas of several other works, including movies // shows like Interstellar and Netflix's "Bodies", but accompanied by really lovely and lyrical writing from Mandely. While it tackles similarly complex topics as Blindsight, it's much easier to pick up for readers coming from any genre, and grounds its more complex ideas with narratives that draw you in and keep you interested in the story as well as the science // metaphysics // time travel going on throughout.
